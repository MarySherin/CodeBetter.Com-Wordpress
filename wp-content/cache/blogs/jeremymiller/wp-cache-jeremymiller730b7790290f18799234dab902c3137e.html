		<description>&quot;You&#039;re going to make a very opinionated, inflammatory post and get criticized for it.&quot;

This is also known as the &quot;Stored Procedures Post.&quot;</description>

		<description>Time is the only factor that is putting me back from blogging. But the time spent is definitely worthwhile with all the pros listed above. 

Blogging also allow me to reflect more on what I have done, rather than just doing stuff for the seek of doing without having more in depth understanding.</description>

		<description>Hysterical! You the positive force in the universe. Your job (and others here) is to mock them and the arguments and positioning yours as the only ones that matter.</description>

		<description>Excellent Post.

I couldn&#039;t agree more with you on the positive aspects of blogging. Besides helping my crystallize my thoughts on a topic, it has also led me to dig much deeper into topics than I ever used to before. The implicit threat of a commenter calling me out for my carelessness has definitely led me to improve my researching habits as well as be more willig to pre-emptively look at issues from different angles. 

I also heartily agree with your thoughts on the &quot;It&#039;s all been said&quot; objection. It prevented me from blogging for years, but now I have a list of potential post topics that is about a hundred items long that I never seem to get to because something more interesting always pops up first.

While the echo chamber affect is certainly a blogging anti-pattern, I&#039;ve found that there are an infinite number of interesting variations on an old theme that can still make it valuable to readers. Some of the best blog posts I&#039;ve read have just taken tired old topics that I never really understood before and gave it just the right amount of context for me to finally experience the ah-ha momment.

Anyways. Keep up the excellent work. I consider your blog to be one of the better examples of &quot;how to do a blog right&quot;.</description>

		<description>Nice post. I blog because I simply love writing, and it helps me to crystallize my points, as you said.</description>

		<description>Crystalizing your thoughts is so critical in our field, and in many ways is neglected while we pursue new technology and techniques.  

One additional comment I&#039;d add to the flatlining of creativity is that any of the true masters, Mozart, Beethoven, grandmasters of chess like Bobby Fisher or Josh Waitzkin have all take at least 10 years to perfect their craft.  You may hit a a lull, but that may be a plateau that needs to be cleared or surpassed before you reach the next level.  </description>
