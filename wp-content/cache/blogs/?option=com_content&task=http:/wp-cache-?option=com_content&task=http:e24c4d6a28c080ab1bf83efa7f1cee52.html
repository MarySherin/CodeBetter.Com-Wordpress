				<p>For the last three years Chris and I have been working on MassTransit in various amounts of capacity. I am very excited to see us both back in active development again. I hope to see a few releases this year in preparation for a solid 2.0 leveraging everything we have learned from Actor based programming.</p>
<p>Also plan to see several small releases in alternate languages which I will be using to explore the benefits that other languages might bring to us in the .Net community. Currently this includes basic support in python, ruby, and javascript. Next up is Scala and then hopefully C (I have a lot to learn about C though).</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>I had a great time at CodeMash yet again.&nbsp; For those of us who look at software development as more of a lifestyle than just a way to meet the mortgage, these kinds of events are like a huge dose of nutrition for the soul.&nbsp; I really liked <a href="http://scottchacon.com/">Scott Chacon</a>’s keynote address and it’s got my head a going about how to make our workplace better (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc">see this again</a>).</p>
<h2>Happiness and Work</h2>
<p>I learned the hard way that I can’t attain personal happiness from work alone.&nbsp; That being said, your workplace, career, and profession is a big part of who you are and most certainly impacts how happy you are in life.&nbsp; I constantly meet developers who feel like they’re being ground down by their soul-crushing jobs.&nbsp; </p>
<p>It’s a familiar litany of complaints:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being forced to work with bad tools and having no say in the matter
<li>Too many hours
<li>Poor quality of work.&nbsp; Personally, I can deal with heavy hours over short periods of time but fighting with bad code or knowing that my team didn’t do a very good job on something depresses me.
<li>Being treated as disposable or replaceable units
<li>Apathetic co-workers.&nbsp; In a good situation your coworkers should inspire you, not drag you down</li>
</ul>
<p>My only advice to you is to get out, go someplace else.&nbsp; There are good places to work where you’ll enjoy your coworkers, do challenging work, have autonomy, and feel energized just by being there.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Don’t accept a bad situation.&nbsp; If you can’t change your current environment, then get out of there.&nbsp; Prepare yourself.&nbsp; Up your skillset.&nbsp; Do OSS work to sharpen your skills and network.&nbsp; If absolutely nothing else, just doing the preparation work for another job should help end the feelings of hopelessness.</p>
<p>It took me about a decade to more or less get there, but I did and you can too.&nbsp; And if you are miserable at work, at least remember to enjoy the hell out of your non-work life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>FubuMVC was well received…</h2>
<p>I was very happy with how well received FubuMVC was at my workshop at CodeMash, but some of the typical responses don’t particularly encourage me:</p>
<ul>
<li>FubuMVC looks great, but we can’t use non-Microsoft tools…
<li>Yeah, ASP.Net MVC isn’t that great, but it’s better than WebForms…
<li>I’ve given up on anything from .Net, I’m going to Rails…</li>
</ul>
<p>The .Net world sucks because of our weird unipolar world where Redmond dominates and seems to suck all the oxygen out of every other solution.&nbsp; I’m not completely ready to throw in the towel and write one of those obnoxious “I’m awesome ‘cause I got a new Ruby job and you .Net guys all suck” blog posts, but I do consider my future options and writing code on mediocre frameworks from Redmond isn’t part of the future I envision.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Loyalty</h2>
<p>Always be loyal to your family and your friends.&nbsp; Try to be loyal to your sports team even in bad years.&nbsp; Be loyal to your teammates.&nbsp; Be loyal where loyalty is valuable, but for goodness sake, that does not extend to your development platform or tools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>You don’t need to win every argument</h2>
<p>I was around the periphery of an argument about using Git vs. TFS and let’s just say that one half of the conversation had no interest in changing his mind while the other half thought it was important to change the first person’s mind.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In your career you’re going to learn new and better ways of doing things, be really excited about those new ways, and immediately find out that you can’t get other people to see the same advantages that you do.&nbsp; Moreover, those people aren’t going to like you if you attack the ways and tools that they use to build software.&nbsp; If you’re not careful, you can easily do more harm than good to yourself even though you were trying to make things better for other people.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I still stand by most of what I wrote a couple years ago in a <a href="http://codebetter.com/jeremymiller/2009/03/02/a-coalition-of-the-willing/">Coalition of the Willing</a>:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>“W” is still the worst US president of the last 100 years
<li>I’m coming around to the idea that causing a confrontation with traditional .Net development via the EF VONC was absolutely worth doing, if badly mismanaged on our side (ALT.NET).&nbsp; The non-ALT.NET folks in the argument behaved terribly too, but somehow <strong>they</strong> didn’t have to put up with “Why so mean?” crap.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul><!--EndFragment--></ul>
<h2>Quick Things</h2>
<ul>
<li>About TFS, have you ever heard anything positive about TFS from anybody besides TFS consultants or Microsoft employees (I’m including the regional directors here)?&nbsp; I haven’t.
<li>As far as I can tell, Git has an almost dominant mindshare around version control right now.&nbsp; You’re either using Git, trying to convince your team to go to Git, planning for Git, or defending your decision to use something else.
<li>Self promotion is an essential ingredient of being a highly successful software developer, but don’t you ever dare forget that you need to actually get better rather than just work on looking better.&nbsp; Remember that it’s important to go to places, groups, and conferences where you’re not the smartest guy in the room.&nbsp; And yeah, anybody in Austin knows exactly who I’m talking to here.
<li>Microsoft is losing the high end developers.&nbsp; This theme never seems to go away, and it was front and center at CodeMash yet again.&nbsp; Ask high end .Net developers what they’re learning or excited about and you almost never hear an answer that originates in Redmond.&nbsp; Lots of Node.js, Rails, Scala, and Python, but nothing .Net centric.&nbsp; I think Microsoft is probably right from the business perspective to put most of their eggs toward lower skilled developers, but running off most of the upper end might end up hurting them.
<li>The population of high end developers certainly overlaps with all the MVP’s, but there’s a tremendous amount of mediocrity running around with MVP slathered all over their resumes.&nbsp; Don’t take the MVP club membership too seriously, either as a member or an outsider.</li>
</ul>

				<p>I had a lot of people ask me at CodeMash when I’m doing such and such or how something else was going.&nbsp; Honestly, I’d like to do less this year but enjoy it more.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Here’s my rundown of stuff for this year:</p>
<ul>
<li>FubuMVC development has really taken off in the last couple months and we’re getting significant input and contributions from people not named “Jeremy.”&nbsp; After the workshop at CodeMash and the way it was received, I think it’s time to focus on making FubuMVC more approachable with documentation and bootstrapping tools rather than developing new features.&nbsp; I think we’re getting close to the first official release.&nbsp; I’m very confident right now that we’ll have a compelling case for using FubuMVC for web development on .Net, but I know that gaining acceptance for a non-Microsoft tool is essentially nil.&nbsp; Regardless, I’m enjoying FubuMVC, so expect it to continue.
<li>I’m starting to enjoy blogging again, so expect a little bit more of that this year (but 2007 levels are forever gone).
<li>StructureMap 3.0 will be coming with a release in the 2nd quarter.&nbsp; This release is all about making SM’s architecture the best that it can be to better support the crazy ass scenarios you guys throw at it these days.&nbsp; I’m mostly working on FubuMVC right now, but I’m going to pick up StructureMap again soon.&nbsp; Warning though, StructureMap 3 is edging into rewrite territory.&nbsp; I plan on no more than very minimal changes to the public API, but the internals are getting a total redo.&nbsp; For all StructureMap users reading this, please start thinking about your frustrations with the 2.6.* versions and start letting me know what you want improved.
<li>The “Presentation Patterns” book is probably dead.&nbsp; I need to go grovel to my publisher and apologize.&nbsp; I never really made much headway on the book anyway and my priorities got shifted out from underneath me.
<li>StoryTeller is mothballed until at least late summer.&nbsp; I put an absurd amount of effort into StoryTeller last summer, saw very little benefit, and burned out so badly that I couldn’t do anything outside of work hours for several months.&nbsp; At this point, I’d push you towards all the .Net Cucumber clones or Cucumber itself with IronRuby.&nbsp; I’ve got some big plans for StoryTeller, but it might end up being more in the vein of a DSL tool than the original goal of “executable specifications.”&nbsp; If nothing else, I’m going to do a rewrite of the ST user interface by chucking out WPF and doing a full rewrite with pure HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS. </li>
</ul>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>First off, apologies for the delay in writing this one; I can only plead the pressures of work at the end of last year. There are a number of blogs, in the pipe, which I hope you can expect to see soon.</p>
<p>However, I had promised to update people on what happened at that last alt.net conference in the UK, specifically because we declared that it would be the last alt.net conference, feeling that movement had run its course. That outcome was reported on Twitter, but I wanted to go into why, and talk about some ideas for what is next.</p>
<p>Alt.Next took place on <a title="Alt.Next" href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/1014272717">19th\20th November 2010</a> and we were kindly hosted by <a title="Thoughtworks" href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/">Thoughtworks</a>. I gave the keynote on the condition, as I saw it on the state of the Alt.Net movement, something I have talked about <a title="Whither Alt.Net" href="http://codebetter.com/iancooper/2010/01/19/whither-alt-net/" target="_blank">here before on Codebetter</a>, but the history, as I saw it, is worth repeating here.</p>
<p><strong>A brief history of how the MS software community learned new ideas</strong></p>
<p>15 years ago, for the old hands amongst us, most our deep understanding came from books or from peers. There were rock star developers who we learned from. Just look at the Wrox publications of this period for the epitome of this rock star author movement with its, somewhat cringe-worthy, photos of geek celebrities embossed on its front covers. I can remember poring over copies of MFC Internals and Revolutionary Guide to MCF4 Programming with Visual C++.</p>
<p>But the problem was that knowledge was  ghettoized; most folks read the books they needed, and magazines like MSDN. There seemed to be very little cross pollination of ideas outside individuals moving jobs.</p>
<p>10 years ago, the Internet started to become a source of technical knowledge. Now there were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system">BBS</a> systems before this, but I don&#8217;t think they had the same reach. In my recollection, the real explosion here  corresponded with the emergence of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28software_platform%29">Java</a>. Java was cool and even places like The Well had Java forums where developers could gather and talk about this new language. It was either something to do with the paradigm shift caused by Java creating a new playing field, in which the old rock stars had to work to avoid looking like yesterday&#8217;s heroes, or the cross-fertilization as people from myriad former communities come together within Java; but somehow there seemed to be a greater sharing of knowledge. The masters were revealing their secrets to the journeymen and apprentices. It was a major shift in the availability of knowledge, and even books seemed to change to reflect that.</p>
<p>To my recollection this was the beginning of the first Windows Developer Diaspora. A lot of smart kids wrote leaving MS emails and forum posts and moved to Java. Plus ca change. Eventually MS reacted and moved to stop the diaspora with their own extensions to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jvm">JVM</a>, and following that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Language_Runtime">CLR</a>.</p>
<p>But the result of this explosion of knowledge, and the peering over the fence from some MS developers, looking to see what all this Java noise was about, led to a few of them encountering new ideas. New ideas like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping">ORMs</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_Control">IoC</a> containers. And some of them realized that the similarities between Java and C# gave them the ability to port some of these <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">OSS</a> projects into the .NET space to get the leg up on using them themselves.</p>
<p>In addition, as these MS developers looked to the Java community to understand best practices that might help them use their new frameworks, they stumbled across agile software engineering.</p>
<p>But&#8230;this cross fertilization did not seem to spread widely in the MS community. A lot of them were so busy fighting a rearguard action around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Foundation_Class_Library">MFC</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic">VB</a> that they already saw .NET as an invader, let alone ideas from other communities. I think they were afraid of the &#8216;promiscuous&#8217; behavior of.NET developers who flirted with these new ideas; they threatened the rock star developers dominion. And that frustrated those &#8216;promiscuous&#8217; developers who were excited by the possibilities of these new ideas, who saw a better, faster way of working. But without widespread understanding of these ideas, adoption was always a struggle, and these &#8216;promiscuous&#8217; developers became angry that no one was spreading the good news of the better way to their colleagues and managers, forcing them to work with impoverished tools and practices.</p>
<p>And I think it was in this context, that in 2008 a number of &#8216;promiscuous&#8217; MVPs gather at MVP summit. Many are folks you would recognize as current of alumni CodeBetter bloggers. They clustered together through shared beliefs that the .NET community was blind and deaf to other practices, frameworks and patterns, and that MS was happy to let them remain in the dark. Their anger coalesced around the Entity Framework, which was seen as a poor alternative to Nhibernate, or even LINQ to SQL for folks that wanted to work in a new way.</p>
<p>Because they were associated with the EF rebellion they became knows as the NHibernate mafia at first. <a href="http://laribee.com/altnet">But David Laribee gave them a new name, and a manifesto from hacker culture with Alt.Net</a>.</p>
<p>Some may feel the Alt.Net movement succeeded, some may feel it failed. However, awareness of agile software engineering ideas like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_%28object-oriented_design%29">SOLID</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a> is far greater, as our tools like ORMs or IoC containers. When MVC frameworks began their rise with Rails, the .NET community furnished Monorail and later MS produced ASP.NET MVC. Flawed or not, I think that the movement promulgated greater understanding of why these ideas were important. Now more and more people can work environments where these ideas can be pushed and adopted. So I think the Alt.NET movement achieved something, and I don&#8217;t think it should be regretted.</p>
<p>But of late the movement seems stalled. The question is what does that mean for the future of Alt.NET.</p>
<p><strong>Our Discussions</strong></p>
<p>A lot of the conversation on the day at Alt.Next can be centered around two perceived problems with the Alt.NET movement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Messianic.NET</li>
<li>The New Orthodoxy</li>
</ul>
<p>Many attendees brought stories of developers for whom Alt.NET was a negative moniker, applied to someone who is pushy and arrogant; with the implication that their ideas were somehow ivory-tower, not for us, and impractical. There was a feel that the &#8216;missionary&#8217; nature of the Alt.NET community had done more to offend that inform, and had often been too messianic. No one likes to be made to feel stupid, but the Alt.NET community made a lot of people feel that way.</p>
<p>The danger of the new orthodoxy can be summed up as the belief that Alt.NET is really just a set of tools. A TDD framework, an IoC container, an ORM, and an MVC web framework. Hence the question from outside: given decent versions of all those, isn&#8217;t the problem over &#8211; can&#8217;t Alt.NET just go away? Even deeper the problem seems to be that its not just generic versions of these tools but NHibernate over EF, anything over Unity, etc. that are required to prove your credibility to the movement. There even seems to be an orthodoxy that anyone not using R# is poor software developer who cares little for his craft. &#8220;By their works ye shall know them,&#8221; seems to be the mantra of this witch-hunt.</p>
<p>I think that none of the attendees believed that this was what Alt.NET had originally meant. Indeed David&#8217;s proposition had been: &#8220;It’s not the tools, it’s the solution&#8230;When tools, practices, or methods become mainstream it’s time to get  contrarian; time to look for new ways of doing things; time to shake it  up&#8221;.</p>
<p>And I think for my part, and many others is that whilst Alt.NET should now be about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL">NoSQL</a>, J<a href="http://goutamdey.com/2010/01/02/5-javascript-mvc-frameworks-2/">avascript MVC frameworks</a>, <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> etc. it seems mired in what was, not what is next, what we need to improve to be better. And in turn when those are done, it needs to move on.</p>
<p>And so we decided to abandon the Alt.NET moniker for future open space events.We want to move away from waging a war to spreading ideas. It is about cross-pollination with other communities, platforms. Going out to listen to other conversations and bringing that back into the .NET space. Innovating and taking those ideas out of the .NET space.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not even sure what the &#8220;new thing&#8221; should be called, or even if naming it matters, and is not a mistake. Perhaps Alt.NET is dead as a movement; others may still find it useful to identify the like minded, but whatever you want to call it, I think its important to embrace the manifesto that David outlined long ago over what it became in between:</p>
<p>&#8220;Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote “there are always two parties; the  establishment and the movement.” If you’re ALT.NET, you’re in the  movement. You’re shaking out the innovation. When the movement fails,  stalls, or needs improving you’re there starting/finding/supporting that  next leap forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>For our purpose though, Alt.NET is dead. I sing its praises, but its time to find the next leap forward.</p>
<p><strong>The New Diaspora</strong></p>
<p>One postscript is that once again we seem to be experiencing a diaspora. Once again ideas outside the community burn very brightly. Ideas that cannot simply be ascribed to tools but to approaches and practices. In this case I believe it is partly the OSS ecosystem that non-MS software communities support so much better. Perhaps our new movement will truly be born from a reaction to this crisis, as much as Alt.NET was to the last.</p>

IN PRINT<br />
Jon Skeet<br />
November 2010 | 584 pages<br />
ISBN: 9781935182474</p>
<p><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">This article is taken from the book C# in Depth, Second Edition. The author explains optional parameters, whose values don’t have to be explicitly specified by the caller. He also talks about named arguments. The idea of named arguments is that, when you specify an argument value, you can also specify the name of the parameter it’s supplying the value for.</span></p>
<p>Optional parameters and named arguments are perhaps the Batman and Robin<sup><a href="#ftnt1">[1]</a></sup> features  of C# 4. They’re distinct but usually seen together. I’m going to keep  them apart for the moment so we can examine each in turn, but then we’ll  use them together for some more interesting examples.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #008000;">PARAMETERS AND ARGUMENTS</span> This  article obviously talks about parameters and arguments a lot. In casual  conversation, the two terms are often used interchangeably, but I’m  going to use them in line with their formal definitions. A parameter (also known as a formal parameter) is the variable that’s part of the method or indexer declaration. An argument is an expression used when calling the method or indexer. So, for example, consider this snippet:</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp">void Foo(int x, int y)
{
	// Do something with x and y
}
...
int a = 10;
Foo(a, 20);</pre>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Here the parameters are x and y, and the arguments are a and 20.</p>
<p>We’ll start by looking at optional parameters.</p>
<h2>Optional parameters</h2>
<p>Visual  Basic has had optional parameters for ages, and they’ve been in the CLR  from .NET 1.0. The concept is as obvious as it sounds: some parameters  are optional, so their values don’t have to be explicitly specified by  the caller. Any parameter that hasn’t been specified as an argument by  the caller is given a default value. <a href="http://codebetter.com/2011/01/11/c-in-depth-optional-parameters-and-named-arguments-2/#more-119" class="more-link">Continue&nbsp;reading&nbsp;<span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>
