It&#8217;s just TDD + DDD reframed into a way that is easier to teach to developers&nbsp; who are new to the concept (as part of a great explanation by Aaron Feng and further discussed with Raymond Lewallen). </p>
<p>There are however many differences and in my opinion DDD and BDD should never even be compared to each other as they have almost nothing in common. As we shall see with the differences they are<b> </b>about language whether for our development team or for the project as a whole&#8230;</p>
<p></p>
<p>This afternoon I emailed <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/scott.bellware/default.aspx">Scott Bellware</a> about some concerns I had with BDD. After work (and each of us each going away for a moment for refreshments to partake in during the discussion he a pumpkin ale and I a Corona) we had one of the most intellectually interesting discussions that I have had in a long while&#8230;</p>
<p>I posed to Scott the following BDD concern &#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>BDD is often described as being TDD + DDD. When I look at the artifacts generated from BDD though I tend not to see what I would consider to be part of the Ubiquitous Language but something which is at a higher more naive level (similar to what Evans describes in finding obvious nouns *see below*). How does BDD</p>
<p>1) Find the deeper model as we do in DDD </p>
<p>2) Move forward with the ubiquitous language as the artifacts will require vast refactoring in order to keep pace with the model and as it said in DDD &#8220;Documents should compliment code and speech&#8221; thus it is imperative that these artifacts stay updated with the current ubiquitous language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mention of Evans in regards to obvious nouns here specifically relates to DDD page 30:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The detachment of speech from other forms of communication is a particularly great loss because we humans have a genius for spoken language. Unfortunately, when people speak they usually don&#8217;t use the language of the domain model.</p>
<p>That statement may not ring true to you initially, and indeed there are exceptions. But the next time you attend a requirements or design discussion, really listen. You&#8217;ll hear descriptions of features in business jargon or layman&#8217;s versions of the jargon. You&#8217;ll hear talk about technical artifacts and concrete functionality. Sure you&#8217;ll hear terms from the domain model; obvious nouns in the common language from the business jargon will typically be coded as objects, and those terms will tend to be mentioned. But do you hear phrases that could even remotely be described in terms of relationships and interactions in your current domain model?&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be clear :</p>
<p>When I look at the stories that come out of BDD I see the stakeholder describing their model, this is not the same as in DDD where the stakeholders and the developers work to define an ubiquitous language. I will use <a href="http://dannorth.net/">Dan North&#8217;s</a> canonical examples in his <a href="http://dannorth.net/whats-in-a-story">whats in a story post</a>::</p>
<blockquote><p><font face="Courier New">Story: Account Holder withdraws cash       <br />As an Account Holder        <br />I want to withdraw cash from an ATM        <br />So that I can get money when the bank is closed        <br />Scenario 1: Account has sufficient funds        <br />Given the account balance is $100        <br /> And the card is valid        <br /> And the machine contains enough money        <br />When the Account Holder requests $20        <br />Then the ATM should dispense $20        <br /> And the account balance should be $80        <br /> And the card should be returned        <br />Scenario 2: Account has insufficient funds        <br />Given the account balance is $10        <br /> And the card is valid        <br /> And the machine contains enough money        <br />When the Account Holder requests $20        <br />Then the ATM should not dispense any money        <br /> And the ATM should say there are insufficient funds        <br /> And the account balance should be $20        <br /> And the card should be returned        <br />Scenario 3: Card has been disabled        <br />Given the card is disabled        <br />When the Account Holder requests $20        <br />Then the ATM should retain the card        <br />And the ATM should say the card has been retained</font></p>
</blockquote>
<h6><font face="Courier"></font></h6>
<p>We can see exactly what Evans discusses. This story talks of pre and post conditions and will certainly not be relevant in what will eventually be our ubiquitous language if we head down a DDD path, obvious nouns are described but there is little to model off of (this simply brings up questions). Many changes will need to occur as this becomes an ubiquitous language.</p>
<p>When we look at the above text we do not see a true domain model developing. We see a model through the looking glass of a facade (BDD seems excellent at describing facade boundaries!). We see being formed as artifacts things which are merely describing a facade to our model that we intend to keep and refactor into our ubiquitous language when it later develops!</p>
<p>Scott had a very simple reply&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t necessarily think a stakeholder cares (or should care) about the domain model. This is how they view the problem. <i>(Scott blame the corona if I paraphrased you incorrectly)</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the moment I heard this I thought &#8220;sacrilege!&#8221; and was ready to throw out some more DDD &#8220;no no&#8221;s like from the view point of DDD &#8220;One Team, One Language&#8221; it would seem that BDD is falling into a trap already seen many times, quoting Evans:</p>
<blockquote><p>Technical people often feel the need to &#8220;shield&#8221; the business experts from the domain model. They say:</p>
<p>&#8220;Too abstract for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t understand objects.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to collect requirements in their terminology&#8221;</p>
<p>These are just a few of the reasons I&#8217;ve heard for having two languages on the team. Forget them.</p>
<p>Of course their are technical components of the design that may not concern the domain experts, but the core of the model have better interest them. Too abstract? Then how do you know the abstractions are sound? Do you understand the domain as deeply as they do? Sometimes specific requirements are colelcted from lower-level users, and a subset of the more concrete terminology may be needed for them, but a domain expert is assumed to be capable of thinking somewhat deeply about his or her field. <i>If sophisticated domain experts don&#8217;t understand the model, there is something wrong with the model.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alas, I too have had stakeholders such as what Scott describes. In fact thinking back many of them were in the sorts of domains that I would not recommend DDD and <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/david_laribee/archive/2007/09/24/domain-model-overuse.aspx">recently Eric Evans has also had had this discussion</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>I became more and more aware that one of the basic mistakes that model enthusiasts made from the start was the idea that we should just model everything, that the whole system should modeled and object oriented and so on. what I have started to realize is that that dilutes the effort to the point where we don&#8217;t really ever get the bang for the modeling buck and that in fact most systems are probably 90% CRUD (create, read, update, delete) and that there are simpler solutions to that problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>BDD != DDD </b>not even close. <i>Can I say this loud enough?</i> BDD is focused on the cases where DDD does not come into play. In other words for those who remember these types of problems from the SAT &#8230;</p>
<p><b>BDD is to DDD as Active Record is to Domain Model.</b></p>
<p>Unless a grand effort is made BDD does not contain an Ubiquitous Language. It contains a <b>[SHARED LANGUAGE]</b> . Refactoring the BDD artifacts to keep up with the ubiquitous language is probably not a worthwhile task. Many stakeholders do not care to discuss a grand unified language they want <b>their perception of the model</b> <b>to be implemented</b>. Often times these are simple systems with fairly linear processes. The stakeholder doesn&#8217;t give a crap if their is an Account,Transfer method or an AccountTransferService. To him these are details and it is this world that BDD tries to formalize.</p>
<p>BDD focuses on <b>[SHARED LANGUAGE] </b>between the development team and the stakeholder. This may be similar to DDD&#8217;s Ubiquitous Language but is certainly not the same. The developers intentionally hide complexity behind a facade both architecturally and verbally from the stakeholder. In return the stakeholder provides <b>[ACCEPTANCE SPECIFICATIONS]</b> in the <b>[SHAREDLANGUAGE] </b>that the developers may then use as a basis to form an internal abstraction of the system.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Do I agree with BDD&#8217;s <b>[SHARED LANGUAGE]</b>? In my discussion with Scott it was like any other problem I face &#8220;Well it depends&#8221;. I know personally the benefits of a true Ubiquitous Language but at the same time I have dealt with stakeholders who were not that interested in such an effort. They did not care how I modeled the account class so long as from their external view point they saw it in the way they wanted to see it. They wanted the project done to a level of acceptance as fast as could be delivered in a maintainable way with lower TCO.</p>
<p><b><i>Note: there are also times when your experts aren&#8217;t really experts either that this can be a good thing <img src='http://codebetter.com/gregyoung/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </i></b></p>
<p>As such we come to the root issue, is their lower TCO with an ubiquitous language or a shared language. I think the benefits of ubiquitous language over shared language are directly proportional to the amount of complex logic contained in a system compared to the amount of simple logic in a system <b><i>(providing you want a unified model)</i></b>. In the long term I think BDD wins that 70+% of the time as it really is an amortization for the simple cases (it just has a much worse worst case). <b><i></i></b></p>
<p>I personally will stay with DDD but in general it is important to note that there is <b>NO </b>ubiquitous language with BDD, to maintain one is too difficult and costly, if you seek an ubiquitous language re-read DDD. Instead a <b>[SHARED LANGUAGE] </b>is used which can almost be viewed as a context mapping in DDD.</p>
<p><i>Side note: Scott had another very interesting quote worth mentioning when I tried looking at it as a matter of a DDD context mapping with the stakeholder being a boundary.</i></p>
<blockquote><p><i>Its not a matter of looking at it differently, its a matter of looking at it at a different level of detail.</i></p>
</blockquote>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I like the &#8220;depends&#8221; comparison between the two. Simply put, it seems that BDD will work well when you have business stakeholders that will strongly resist an effort at having a ubiquitous language but will find the easy framework of &#8220;as a __, I want to__, so that __&#8221; framework for communicating what is wanted and evaluating the value of it compared to other things that are wanted.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>I wanted to clarify my relationship to BDD: the first time I heard of it was last night at XTC NYC meeting from Dave Laribee. I have since read a tiny bit about BDD and some of it made sense, but now I wonder what the relationship between the Shared and the Ubiquitous languages is from BDD point of view. </p>
<p>In my (BDD-ignorant) opinion, if we really care to drive our design by the domain, we will work to have one and only one language on the team, and make sure this language is shared by everyone including the customer, the developers and the domain experts (is this what BDD calls stakeholders?), making it ubiquitous. </p>
<p>We do start with user stories. We try to express our initial model in the language of the stories. We do it via TDD (which in this case stands for test-driven DESIGN). It also expresses our application&#8217;s behavior from the point of view of the outside world.</p>
<p>But then, as we continue to model (and go beyond the Facades or whatever it is that defines our application behavior), we refine that language, and quite possibly re-formulate the stories in that refined language. The language keeps evolving, reflecting our deeper insight into the model. We keep changing our code to reflect the new model, and so forth&#8230;</p>
<p>Now my question, again: is the &#8220;Shared Language&#8221; that initial language in which the customer expresses the stories? Does it ever evolve? If yes, isn&#8217;t it the same as Ubiquitous language? If not, doesn’t it add confusion by now having two languages and the need to translate between them? Or is shared a subset of ubiquitous that the customer cares about?</p>
<p>Please un-confuse me. </p>
<p>Thanks a lot!<br />
Vladimir</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Great point Vladimir! I had actually done a search/replace on domain expert and customer to stakeholder. You are 110% correct a domain expert is not necessarily a stakeholder! The term stakeholder should in many places stay though as I see BDD coming forward in a stakeholders point of view, that stakeholder may or may not be a domain expert!</p>
<p>Great job at illustrating another key difference <img src='http://codebetter.com/gregyoung/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Great post. </p>
<p>One comment: DDD talks about domain experts. They are not necessarily stakeholders. These two roles are orthogonal (although *sometimes* played by the same people). </p>
<p>I ask stakeholders for stories. This results in Shared Language.<br />
I talk with domain experts to figure out the model. This over time results in Ubiquitous Language.</p>
<p>Just wanted to emphacise  on these distinctions.</p>

<p>I think one of the big stinks out of altnetconf was the fact that the BDD discussion didn&#8217;t go in the right direction. This post really starts that discussion with solid examples and context. I actually had to read it twice and still haven&#8217;t grasped it all. </p>
<p>The way you compare BDD to ActiveRecord helped a lot, but I&#8217;m wondering where that really leaves DDD. Most of our application logic is complex and comes from a large history of legacy code so trying to change the implementation of that logic is challenging if not forbidden. Yet when you lay out your CRUD sections, would you not want to make sure that the objects you&#8217;re defining for those operations are based in a solid domain model? Otherwise, you have something that is only mildly interesting to the rest of the application code. Maybe I&#8217;m not understanding this entirely, or maybe I misread your comparison. </p>
<p>Or maybe I still just don&#8217;t get it. <img src='http://codebetter.com/gregyoung/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif' alt=':(' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>this is one of the best posts i&#8217;ve read in a long time&#8230;</p>
<p>i&#8217;m not sure the two are mutually exclusive. i&#8217;m not sure you&#8217;re saying this either.</p>
<p>to me it seems that ideas like core sub-domains and abstracted core would permit a general sense of shared language where bounded contexts permit a ubiquitous language around a particularly complex area. i&#8217;m calling this a dropstone architecture. so generally you have lots of entities, aggregate roots, repositories in your model but you use the concept of modules to cordon off domain models.</p>
<p>this is wildly articulate. i&#8217;ll have to refine &#038; post&#8230;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>BDD does contain a ubuquitous language of its own; some of its domain objects are Story, Scenario, Event, Outcome and Behaviour. It&#8217;s a meta-language for software development, and because even the business can understand what a Scenario is, or what an Outcome might be, we can now talk about the behaviour of the whole system in a way which makes (more) sense to everyone. It isn&#8217;t a silver bullet, but it&#8217;s been very helpful on the couple of very large projects I&#8217;ve been on, in developing JBehave itself, and in teaching others how they can start developing software and adopt Agile practices.</p>
<p>The Story you have above isn&#8217;t an artifact of BDD, but an artifact of successful software development. However you record them, every project has Stories (&#8216;features&#8217; or &#8216;requirements&#8217; are part of a Story) and Scenarios (sometimes called &#8216;acceptance criteria&#8217;). A story is merely a feature which could deliver some benefit to someone in a particular role. Writing stories in this way has helped us to drive out the ubiquitous language (for instance, we&#8217;ve had conversations which, in the above, would have led to &#8216;machine&#8217; being replaced by &#8216;ATM&#8217; throughout). The scenarios aren&#8217;t static; they can change as new stories are introduced, overlooked features are discovered, etc.</p>
<p>As for modelling; in BDD, each of the contexts, events and outcomes becomes a piece of code. Our domain doesn&#8217;t just consist of the easy nouns like &#8216;Account&#8217; and &#8216;Card&#8217;, but also the common steps &#8211; contexts, events and outcomes &#8211; in various scenarios, such as &#8216;TheAccountShouldDispense(Money)&#8217; and &#8216;TheCardIsValid&#8217;.</p>
<p>(In JBehave and sometimes elsewhere, we use the word Given instead of Context because Context is so overloaded.)</p>
<p>The ATM example is extremely simple, and designed more to teach people what a Story or a Scenario is than to show the power of BDD. The Hellbound tetris game, checked into the JBehave code base, is probably a better example of BDD in action. Of course, the best way to learn more is to have a go yourself.</p>
<p>Does any of this make sense? I&#8217;m always looking for better ways to explain BDD, and it&#8217;s obvious we&#8217;ve missed something here. Please ping me or the JBehave team and let us know what you think.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I would generally agree with your insight re: shared language vs ubiquitous. BDD can drive the model, if you want it to. <img src='http://codebetter.com/gregyoung/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>In the large financial firm that a few of the Los Techies folks work for, it is generally accepted that we will strive for ubiquitous terms and comprehension of the model. We are too big, too regulated and there are too many fine details to try to sort through for there to exist too many different contexts.</p>
<p>Of course, note that I say &#8220;strive&#8221; and not that we &#8220;will have&#8221; since, as you said, it all &#8220;just depends&#8221; in the end. <img src='http://codebetter.com/gregyoung/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  </p>
<p>IMO, BDD tells us WHY something exists, whereas DDD tells us ABOUT something that exists.</p>
