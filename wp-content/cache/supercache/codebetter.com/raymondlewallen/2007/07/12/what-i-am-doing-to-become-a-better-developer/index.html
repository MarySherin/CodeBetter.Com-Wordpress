<p>For me, the first and best step to take in becoming a better developer is that daily realization of how much I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; When I read blogs or talk to other people or read a chapter in a book, its just overwhelming how much information goes along with this career path.&nbsp; Perhaps that is wehy recently I&#8217;ve been really stirring the pot in my head and really thinking about how much longer I&#8217;m really going to write code as my primary job function.&nbsp; I&#8217;m always going to write code (everything I hit the W key on my keyboard an E comes out with it and its really starting to piss me off) because I love the problem solving that goes with being a developer.&nbsp; I love refactoring code.&nbsp; I wish &#8220;refactorer&#8221; was my official job title and primary job function.&nbsp; I think its fun as hell and resharper helps to make it fun.&nbsp; However, I really want to move towards more of a coaching role, where I can sit and code with other team members, do that for a few months and then move to a new team.&nbsp; I think I&#8217;d really enjoy doing something like that.&nbsp; Now the question becomes am I good enough of a teacher to do that?&nbsp; My big problem is I&#8217;m not really a people person when it comes to work.&nbsp; I can be rude and condescending at times, and I am making an active effort to curb that type of behavior when I sense it happening.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not going to be a successful fulltime coach until I can handle some of my attitude issues.&nbsp; I also can be arrogant and display egotistical behavior, but I&#8217;m fine with that.&nbsp; I feel it almost necessary to be able to voice your opinions, be confident in yourself and your arguments, and fight your battles well.&nbsp; That comes off to many people as elitist, and so be it.&nbsp; At the same time, accept defeat graciously and be humble.&nbsp; There&#8217;s always someone nearby that&#8217;s going to know more than you do about a given subject matter.</p>
<p>Honestly, I really am very busy lately,&nbsp;when I&#8217;m not procrastinating (see below).&nbsp; I have a manical almost 4 year old who is just totally messed up in the head and is a freak of nature.&nbsp; I honestly don&#8217;t understand how kids find the energy and complete random behaviors that they do.&nbsp; She&#8217;s crazy.&nbsp; She really is.&nbsp; She gets it from her mother.&nbsp; I spend a lot of time with her because we have a 3 month old at home now too and my stay at home wife needs all the breaks she can get.&nbsp; I take my daughter out on the weekends and we fish or swim or *cough*dropheroffatgrandparentswhileIgotothecasino*cough* or just walk around the mall and have lunch.&nbsp; I enjoy spending time with my daughter, and that is, I&#8217;m sure you would all agree, more important that anything that I could do to evolve myself as a developer.&nbsp; I have to make sure I&#8217;m evolving as a father first, then take care of the secondary things.&nbsp; Raising my children is my real career.&nbsp; Getting to write software for money is just a perk, because its my hobby anyways.</p>
<p>So back to the original topic at hand, here&#8217;s my list of things that I want to address over the near future to become a better developer:</p>
<p><strong>Things I Should Do</strong></p>
<p>Same as Jeremy, work on planning and estimation skills.&nbsp; I attended a 2 day Mike Cohn course, and it was awesome.&nbsp; He&#8217;s a great teacher.&nbsp; I want to spend more time with guys like him who have an incredible amount of real world successes and failures to draw on when coaching.&nbsp; I need to pick up everything he&#8217;s and a few others have written on agile planning and estimation.</p>
<p>I started my career in the database.&nbsp; I was a DBA for many years prior to really getting heavy into programming.&nbsp; Since Sql Server 2005 came out, I&#8217;ve really not done much database work and I&#8217;m missing it.&nbsp; I love design, modeling, tuning and other developer-based tasks.&nbsp; Its the actual admin crap that I really never liked.&nbsp; SqlSvr2005 has some really awesome features, and I was doing a lot with them back in 2005.&nbsp; I want to get back into databases again.&nbsp; Those of you who were reading this blog back in 2005 can probably recall that well over half of all my posts were database/T-SQL related.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know Ruby.&nbsp; Never even looked at it.&nbsp; Boo as well.&nbsp; I keep reading so many awesome things, but I just&#8230; can&#8217;t&#8230; squeeze&#8230;more time into my day.&nbsp; I need to learn both and what they can do for me.</p>
<p>AgileDevelopers.Org.&nbsp; I need to get something done with that.&nbsp; I started the Oklahoma Agile Developers group, which is headed by a committee comprised of .Net, Java and Ruby user group leaders and practitioners.&nbsp; My focus is a language agnostic workshop group.&nbsp; If anybody wants to help with the website and get something going with me on a worldwide scale through the website, or if you have other ideas, just let me know.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not sure what I want to do with the website yet, but the possibilities are awesome and no doubt some things can be done with it from a shear repository viewpoint that would certainly help me become a better developer if the information were available and easily accessible and organized.&nbsp; But, that&#8217;s what google is for.</p>
<p>Quit procrastinating.&nbsp; I&#8217;m normally not bad about this, but I&#8217;ve been so incredibly busy this year that I&#8217;ve been finding myself just stopping and doing nonsense stuff more often that I should.&nbsp; Fishing every weekend does not count as nonsense stuff.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what I do to maintain sanity.&nbsp; But when I pulled out the old super nintendo last week out of the attic to play Gauntlet Legends and Castlevania, well, I&#8217;m not getting many books read, posts finished (I have well over a dozen unfinished blog posts) or emails sent.</p>
<p><strong>Things I Want to Do</strong></p>
<p>Spec#.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve played with this in the past, and really liked what its does for DbC software development.&nbsp; I want (damn you W key!!) to get back to playing with it again and really get into it.&nbsp; Greg Young and I have occasional conversations about it and his enthusiam and knowledge about the language extension keeps my hyped up about it.&nbsp; Thanks Greg!</p>
<p>F#.&nbsp; Functional languages in general really.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve talked to several people who really dig F#, but on the same token they understand functional programming better than I do, so I have some work to do.&nbsp; With Spec# I understand it, grok it well, have written some apps utilizing it and knowe where I can go with it.&nbsp; F# not so much.&nbsp; I hear a lot of talk about possibilities with F#, but I just don&#8217;t have the knowledge to think about what it can do for me, and I need to fill that gap.</p>
<p>Get back to blogging more frequently.&nbsp; Lately I can&#8217;t even read all that I want to, much less find time to blog.&nbsp; When I was blogging more often, I was spending time researching issues, playing with other tools, learning new things about the CLR and just having fun investigation the CLR.&nbsp; If I could find time to blog more, I would be doing those things, which no doubt improves my abilities as a developer.</p>
<p>Not much else I really want to do.&nbsp; I&#8217;m really comfortable with what I have going on right now.&nbsp; I do need to get out of my C# hole though and get back to expanding my horizons and widening my visions of what is possible and easier to do with other languages and concepts.&nbsp; I spent most of last year working on concepts such as DDD and then BDD (both of which I am continuing to educate myself).&nbsp; This year I haven&#8217;t done anything to expand myself in this developer career of mine.&nbsp; Oddly enough, I&#8217;ve been comfortable with that this year.&nbsp; Maybe 13 years into it, my conscience decided its time to take a year off from cramming languages, concepts, methodologies etc into my head.</p>
<p><strong>Things I Won&#8217;t Do</strong></p>
<p>Stop my community involvment.&nbsp; If at all possible, as long as its not at an expense to my family, I will continue everything I do to help my community evolve to become better developers.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve done 9 speaking engagements this year to date, have 7 more scheduled, am planning a code camp (<a href="http://www.okcodecamp.com">www.okcodecamp.com</a>), and am on the steering committee or head of the developer or agile track for 3 other conferences this year.&nbsp; Its a lot of work, a shitton of emails but a lot of fun to see those things be successful.&nbsp; Oh yeah, I&#8217;m also the president the Oklahoma City Developers Group and founder/president of the Oklahoma Agile Developers group.&nbsp; I really enjoy helping the community, which has a lot to do with my thoughts on a slight career change to fulltime coaching/mentoring with some development, rather than full time developer with some coaching/mentoring.&nbsp; I feel my community involvement and relationships that are built help me be a better developer because of the knowledge and perspectives I gain via conversations.</p>
<p>Although at one time I wanted to get into them, WPF, WCF and WWF are not in my plans for the future.&nbsp; Not to say I won&#8217;t learn any or all of them eventually (I own several books on each subject, not opened a single one of them) but for now its hard enough just staying up with domain knowledge.&nbsp; I&#8217;m consulting to oil and gas industry and its a big change for me.&nbsp; I spent 4 years in aviation and felt extremely comfortable with my domain knowledge and ability to find answers.&nbsp; I&#8217;m in a completely new to me industry now and I spend my time learning about it, not new technologies that I obviously don&#8217;t need to solve my design issues.&nbsp; Maybe they are better solutions in a few cases, but the tradeoff against the learning curve involved just isn&#8217;t there.</p>
<p>Tagging these folks</p>
<p><a href="http://www.odetocode.com/" target="_blank">K. Scott Allen</a>&nbsp;(its a given that I always tag K. Scott when these things come around, I&#8217;m sure he appreciates it more than I know), <a href="http://www.danielmoth.com/Blog/index.htm" target="_blank">Daniel Moth</a>, <a href="http://haacked.com/" target="_blank">Phil Haack</a>, <a href="http://www.lnbogen.com/default.aspx" target="_blank">Oren Ellenbogen</a></p>

I&#8217;M FASCINATED W/ YOUR SUCCESS-AND YOUR OPEN MIND TO OTHER PEOPLES OPINIONS TO HELP YOU GET TO THE NEXT LEVEL.,  JUST READING AND REACHING OUT IN A COMMENT WILL HELP ME TO MOVE FORWARD As well.  I want to alter my career in entertainment and get more involved and knowledgeable w/ audio engineering/  and radio broadcasting as well along w/ a sports accomodater.  Much respect to you and your family and along w/ your success.  email me anytime at <a href="mailto:donchadoncha@yahoo.com">donchadoncha@yahoo.com</a> w/ any thoughts , suggestions or advice.

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&#8220;I honestly don&#8217;t understand how kids find the energy and complete random behaviors that they do.&#8221;</p>
<p>I believe that children are born with an additional gland that secretes small amounts of LSD. Around the age of 4-5 it starts to atrophy and eventually disappears as it is metabolized by the body. So, if my theory holds true, the end is near.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Ruby is well worth learning. And so is Python and Lisp. But Ruby heavily borrow from the two and Smalltalk so being familiar with Ruby you&#8217;ll get Python and Lisp faster. Go for it.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Not all related to the main stuff in your post, but&#8230;</p>
<p>When my daughter was 4yrs old, she was quite a handful, but now that she&#8217;s gone thru kindergarten and settled down quite a bit, it&#8217;s simply a blast! Before she was off the wall, but I think the school schedule really changed the way she does things. </p>
<p>Just starting in the Oil &#038; Gas industry huh? I used to do a lot of work in the energy sector with a platform that started out in oil&#038;gas &#8211; OSISoft PI. Pretty neat stuff&#8230;</p>
