<p>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s important about coupling between two things (class/module/infrastructure/subsystem/whatever) named X and Y:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can I understand X in isolation, or do I also have to understand Y at the same time?</li>
<li>Can I change X independently of Y?&nbsp; Or to put it differently, will changing X likely break Y or vice versa, &#8217;cause that would be bad?</li>
<li>Can I test X in isolation without Y hanging around and getting in the way?&nbsp; Or can I verify that X works independently of Y?</li>
<li>Can I use X with a Z instead of a Y?</li>
<li>If I want to reuse X in another context, even if it&#8217;s in the same application, can I do that without having to drag Y along with me?&nbsp; And all of the things that Y needs for that matter?</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m very firmly in the camp that says you should only split assemblies by deployment targets, and even then, I don&#8217;t think you need to be strict about assembly separation.&nbsp; More assemblies == slower compile times (Don&#8217;t believe me?&nbsp; Try it out in VS.Net.&nbsp; I took 56 projects one time and consolidated them down to 10-12 and cut the compile time from 4 minutes to 20 seconds with the same LOC), circular reference problems, and more complicated usage and deployment.&nbsp; Nothing is more irritating to me than using 3rd party toolkits that force you to reference a dozen different assemblies just to do one simple thing.&nbsp; Ok, truth be told, nothing irritates me more than using 3rd party control kits in general &#8212; all the worst API&#8217;s ever created come from .Net control toolkits.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t think your team won&#8217;t adequately follow the basic separation of concerns rules you&#8217;ve determined in your architecture, you&#8217;ll be better off doing something like using CQL constraints with NDepend in your automated build script to find coupling violations.&nbsp; Even with the separate assembly strategy you would still need to use static code analysis to find every coupling violation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One more rant, and I may be leaving the reservation on this one.&nbsp; Obviously, the following rule applies equally to me, but don&#8217;t ever assume for a second that just because someone is an MVP/INETA Speaker/MS Regional Director/&#8221;Professional .Net Gloryhound&#8221; that they know WTF they&#8217;re talking about.&nbsp; Remember that all of those awards are mostly based on visibility and successful self-promotion rather than on strict technical merit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok, I&#8217;m done now.&nbsp; Thank you for listening, I feel better now. </p>

<p>I think the physical separation of code can also be useful in keeping developers wary of the boundaries &#8211; logical separation is too easy to accidentally break, especially for less experienced devs &#8211; adding a reference is a dead give away that something may not be a good idea.</p>
<p>That said, I rarely have a project that goes over 10 assemblies, and even then those are likely over a number of deployment targets &#8211; usually it breaks down to .Core a few .UI or .Web assemblies, perhaps an interfaces assembly, and sometimes a data assembly.</p>

<p>StructureMap.dll has everything related to IoC and DI.  There&#8217;s another assembly called StructureMap.AutoMocking that has the auto mocker that would only be used in test scenarios.  And finally, there&#8217;s StructureMap.DataAccess that is my ancient data access toolkit from the bad old days when we mucked around with ADO.Net directly.</p>
<p>I do keep the testing project separate, and there&#8217;s a couple other assemblies with fake classes just to have something to point StructureMap at.</p>

<p>No, it doesn&#8217;t.  Or at least no more than having separate namespaces within a single assembly.  Even so, all you&#8217;ve done is enforce some ceremony but not the actual intent (i.e. actual, real separation of concerns).</p>
<p>How many times have you worked with devs and said &#8220;we&#8217;re doing MVP&#8221; but still find a lot of logical view behavior embedded directly into the code behind?  Separate assemblies are the exact same thing.  You don&#8217;t have separation of concerns because you&#8217;ve got separate assemblies, and neither does a single assembly preclude separation of concerns.</p>

<p>I think you missed their point, of course it doesn&#8217;t stop people doing things the wrong way, what it does is constantly reminding the developers of how things should be structured. </p>
<p>Personally I normally have 5 assemblies for each project.<br />
1. Core &#8211; common classes used across multiple projects<br />
2. Data &#8211; basically entity classes<br />
3. Services &#8211; service classes<br />
4. Web &#8211; the web site itself<br />
5. Test &#8211; unit tests</p>

<p>That would be me <img src='http://codebetter.com/jeremymiller/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> . I don&#8217;t have a CS degree, didn&#8217;t know SQUAT about DI/IOC until Jeremy walked me through it 3 months ago, and as anyone in Building 42 will tell you, I can write some serious trashy code.</p>
<p>Yet I was an MVP for 2 years running (ASP.NET), was awarded PayPal Developer of the Year (whatever that means) and was recruited by ScottGu to work at the Monster. I don&#8217;t consider myself a GloryHound per se, and if you look at my blog you won&#8217;t see any type of &#8220;badging&#8221; anywhere, short of my Bio (so people know who I am).</p>
<p>Technical Merit is a very small part of what we do. My strengths lie elsewhere: Community, Insight, Ideas, and most of all Execution. I can put things together that frankly many others can&#8217;t &#8211; it&#8217;s just a skill I have.</p>
<p>But take a look at the code I write &#8211; you&#8217;ll laugh. And I invite you to laugh because it allows me to learn &#8211; which is at the core of it all, is it not?</p>
<p>Jeremy I might side with Sam on this a bit &#8211; there really is no need to further the &#8220;Alt.NET Bull##it&#8221; that has come to divide this industry. I&#8217;ve met you and know that you are a lot better than that comment.</p>

If nothing else it forces me to think ‘where do I put this bit of code?, where should it be visible?, who relies on it?, what dependencies am I introducing?’.  I’m not smart enough – nor disciplined enough to have all my layers in the one project without a little tight coupling / boundry crossing creeping in.  So I separate, and it works for me.

You can of course stick all the code into one assembly and everything will work the same. But separation of assemblies adds some additional constraints which are harder to violate accidentally (circular references between logical layers, inability directly to use code in assemblies which are not referenced). It&#8217;s a handy trick.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure why you felt it necessary to defend yourself or turn this into an &#8220;us vs. them&#8221; argument, or what ALT.NET has to do with any of this.</p>
<p>In this particular instance, someone asked Jeremy a StructureMap question and had a particularly misguided view about assemblies and coupling and such.  This view was obtained from some public work a particular MVP had done (not you, don&#8217;t worry) and this person had mistakenly assumed that this was &#8220;Best Practice&#8221; because the work was done by an MVP.</p>
<p>Jeremy&#8217;s point was that having an MVP doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean you know anything. MVP&#8217;s are not chosen strictly on technical merit.  That&#8217;s not a slam on the MVP program nor on MVP individuals, just the perception by the public that MVP == technical expert.</p>
<p>And Rob, by the very fact that you are contributing the MVC Storefront stuff, by my definition at least, makes you *NOT* a Gloryhound. Same goes for Sam Gentile and most of the MVP&#8217;s I know. But that&#8217;s just my opinion.</p>

<p>Once a project hits a certain size you have to think about the vertical partitions as well as the horizontal layers. IMO, placing your module interfaces in a seperate assemblies is critical for larger applications. This allows you to share services accross modules through your container/kernel, without circular references. What if X needs services from Y, and Y needs services from X?</p>

<p>There are people in this world who really understand technology.</p>
<p>Then there are people in this world who are able to take ideas and explain them to others.</p>
<p>Yes, most of those MVPs or awards winners and such are of the latter sort, but that doesn&#8217;t make them less useful and worthwhile to the community.</p>
<p>There are people though who just pass things on without really explaining them just to boost their own credentials.  I don&#8217;t typically see these people getting awards though.</p>

<p>Of course there other reasons to want to partition your assemblies, versioning, team/sub system boundaries.<br />
I  don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll find anyone arguing that having one project shared between 5 teams is a good idea. <img src='http://codebetter.com/jeremymiller/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /><br />
But partitioning just to manage dependencies is unnecessary. </p>

<p>It was mentioned that interfaces do not need to be in separate assemblies. However, in my own experience they sometimes do &#8212; or at least it helps if they are. For example, I am the author of Sudowin, a port of sudo from Unix to Windows. It was written in .NET 1.1 and uses .NET Remoting. Because the client must converse with the server, or remote object, the client needed to know what the server&#8217;s interface contract was. Instead of requiring clients to host the server assembly, I created a Core assembly that contained the common interfaces and other code between client and server. This just seemed like the most elegant solutions.</p>
<p>Now, your advice. I am currently working on re-architecting an application portal. It is my initial thought to place all of the ASP.NET provider implementations and HTTP modules into separate assemblies:</p>
<p>edu.utexas.mccombs.portal.providers.role<br />
edu.utexas.mccombs.portal.providers.authn<br />
edu.utexas.mccombs.portal.providers.profile</p>
<p>edu.utexas.mccombs.portal.httpmods.errors<br />
edu.utexas.mccombs.portal.httpmods.sqlfiles</p>
<p>Of course this will cause all sorts of fun when creating 5 Nant scripts (or using TeamCity&#8217;s capacity to work with MSBuild). Regardless, I could certainly simplify things if I created just two assemblies:</p>
<p>edu.utexas.mccombs.portal.providers<br />
edu.utexas.mccombs.portal.httpmods</p>
<p>I just do not like the idea of needing to update the authentication provider and having that affect the role provider. I suppose though that is my own bias speaking as with version control you absolutely know if other files have been altered. Of course, version control is one of the big reasons to keep these modules as separate assemblies.</p>
<p>What do you guys and gals think? I appreciate your responses. You can always feel free to e-mail me at sakutz at gmail dot com.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>- If you are developing ASP.NET providers or HTTP modules and you wish to redistribute them or wish to manage their versions independently from one another separate assemblies are really the only way to go.</p>
<p>That said, I would love to throw everything into a single assembly. With version control it is certainly possible for people to work on individual files or components of the assembly. But since ASP.NET is largely based on modular components, it makes sense to me to follow that model with your assembly design.</p>

<p>We usually have 5 assemblies per project.<br />
- A core assembly (This is all the shared code we take from project to project)<br />
- Project assembly (this is the DataAccess, Domain, and Business logic for the particular application)<br />
- A Unit Test assembly (Really just the &#8220;Fast Tests&#8221; assembly<br />
- An Integration Test assembly (Really just the &#8220;Slow Tests&#8221; assembly)<br />
- The application controller assembly (UI helpers/controllers/etc)</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it.  I&#8217;ve found the key is to split your assemblies where re-use can occur, which is usually not at the logical seperations.  Realistically are you ever going to reuse the data-access layer without the domain layer or vice-versa?</p>

						<div id="dsq-comment-message-4638" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>As a deployment engineer ( fancy way for saying Build/Install guy )  I typically don&#8217;t care about many of the underlying details of .NET code.   After all,  unless the build breaks it&#8217;s not really a deployment concern whether you properly implemented an interface or something.</p>
<p>What does catch my attention is this type of issue because creating additional projects/assemblies results in a changing footprint for the deployed application to be consumed by an installer.</p>
<p>From that perspective, it&#8217;s important to keep in mind how you intend to service your project once it&#8217;s been deployed.   Do you have any intention patching your product vs doing full release upgrades only?   Do you have any intention of doing product line development methodologies where you might want to reuse certain components across multiple installs?</p>
<p>If so, carefully considering your class relationships and where they should physically belong becomes an important question.   Also having the ability to do things like the following allow for creating very clean windows installer patches:  (TFS scenario):</p>
<p>1) Find the build you want to patch and get it&#8217;s change set #.<br />
2) Create a new branch based on that changeset.<br />
3) Build that branch to reproduce the deployed installer.<br />
4) Merge your patch changesets to the new branch.<br />
5) Perform an incremental build to generate the new the installer.<br />
6) Run the deployed installer and new installer through a patch generation build.</p>
<p>You know end up with foo.msp  which is capable of patching foo.msi v1.0.0.0 to v1.0.0.10.</p>
<p>How small that patch is will depend alot on how your classes are layed out in your assemblies, what changed and what needed to be rebuilt.</p>
<p>Just a thought&#8230;.<br />
  create a branch off of a changeset,  reproduce the deployed build,  merge changesets to that branch a</p>

<p>Not every form of coupling is harmful.  In many cases I&#8217;d say that it is perfectly fine to bind UI elements directly to the Domain Model objects.  If you really need the UI and the Domain Model to be separated I think you need to pay the &#8220;DTO Tax.&#8221;</p>

<p>I guess at some stage something has to be coupled somewhere otherwise you would just end up with a generic framework not capable of much.</p>

						<div id="dsq-comment-message-4642" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Splitting your app up into multiple assemblies has some advantages, I think. Like some people here have already said: having to add a reference to another assembly can be a tell-tale that someting fishy is going on. <img src='http://codebetter.com/jeremymiller/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>However, in some architectures, the odds for single v.s. muliple assembly solutions are reversed. </p>
<p>For instance, when building a system, based on MVP, combined with a plugin architecture (hey, that&#8217;s what we are doing! <img src='http://codebetter.com/jeremymiller/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':P' class='wp-smiley' /> ).</p>
<p>If you create one assembly per module, you can keep everything internal, apart from the plugin class, which needs to be accessible from the outside. </p>
<p>On the other hand, if in this case you had a multiple assembly design, a lot of classes across your assemblies would have to be public. </p>
<p>For example, if you create one assembly for your Views, and one for your Presenters, you probably would have to create a separate Plugin assembly with references to both. And all Views and Presenters that need to be instantiated by the plugin would have to be public, thereby making them vulnerable to misuse by other modules.</p>

<p>The same argument can be made about namespaces in two ways that I&#8217;ve seen time and time again:</p>
<p>1 namespace per assmebly == bad idea.</p>
<p>20 million namespaces with 10 classes each is just as bad as 10 namespaces with 20 million classes each.</p>

						<div id="dsq-comment-message-4644" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Whilst I don&#8217;t always believe in seperating interfaces from implementation I do think more projects can in many cases be useful. Sure it makes builds slower (unless you have sub-solutions) but for larger projects and where reuse is key it can certainly help, I still think Robert Martin has a point:</p>
<p>&#8220;the design of large systems depends critically on good component design, so that individual teams can focus on isolated components instead of worrying about the whole system&#8221;.</p>
<p>Not that I follow this advice too directly though and the whole namespaces idea seems sensible, however having tried it I&#8217;m not so sure its always the answer. Mind you NDepend seems to be getting gradually better and we&#8217;re going to try it on our current project. However the truth is dependencies are currently managed at the project level and the barrier that others describe earlier can be useful.</p>
<p>Also working with fewer but larget projects makes for faster builds but it doesn&#8217;t necessarily aid code navigation, having worked with all sorts of solution structures I find them all deeply dis-satisfying.</p>

<p>You didn&#8217;t read this post very carefully before you commented.  I very clearly stated that I generally only espouse splitting assemblies on deployment lines &#8212; which is exactly the scenario you&#8217;re describing.  Think *logical* coupling.</p>
