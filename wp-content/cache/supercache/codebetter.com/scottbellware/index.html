				<p>Sam&#8217;s post, <a href="/blogs/sam.gentile/archive/2006/09/06/Being-an-Agile-Architect.aspx" target="_blank">Being an Agile Architect</a>, cracks open some&nbsp;fundamental differences between contemporary agile methods and traditional methods.</p>
<p><a href="http://industriallogic.com/" target="_blank">Dave Rooney</a> comments, &#8220;I have talked for years about how the Agile thought leaders are able to already think intuitively of a system&#8217;s architecture, but we mere mortals have to really work at it. We need Agile Architects! Having an Architect doesn&#8217;t mean BDUF, but rather it means that there is someone with an overall vision of what a system should be.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Everyone is a Designer &#8211; and if they&#8217;re not, they better become one</h3>
<p>Dave&#8217;s comment points to a bit of essential understanding that is often lost on folks who only know agile through second-hand-smoke &#8211; that is, through hearsay, some disinformation, and occasionally through FUD.</p>
<p>There is a basic assumption on agile teams that the programmers involved know more about software design than do programmers on traditional teams.&nbsp; Though as Dave rightly points out, as agile is immersed further into the mainstream, it&#8217;s going to encounter teams of programmers whose design skills we&#8217;re never really required to flourish as a basic requirement of their jobs.&nbsp; Agile will inevitably come into contact with teams whose skill levels will progressively be lower than the skills of teams of earlier adopters.&nbsp; I think agile practices will still meet the challenge.</p>
<p>Software design skills risks are mitigated over time as an agile team engages in design-focused practices as part of their moment-by-moment work in implementing solutions under the guise of agile methods.&nbsp; Test-Driven Development and continuous design and code review through Pair Programming will naturally cause programmers&#8217; design skills to deepen.&nbsp; On-going guidance from an experienced designer/architect/coach will fill in many of the rest of the cracks.</p>
<p>Design skills on an agile team deepen by necessity.&nbsp; The bar for software design is higher on agile teams as clean design is a primary enabler of productivity and sustainability.&nbsp; Without good design skills, the most a programming team can hope for is to lean on anti-pattern ridden crutches like Visual Studio&#8217;s flavor of voluntary complexity and tight coupling through its naive RAD tools and practices.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s an Architect to do on an Agile Team?</h3>
<p>The question always seems to pop up: &#8220;What&#8217;s an architect to do on an agile team?&#8221;&nbsp; It&#8217;s not even an honest question.&nbsp; There is an inherent prejudice embedded in the very language used in this question.&nbsp; A more precise wording would be something like, &#8220;What&#8217;s a <i>traditional</i> architect to do on an agile team.&#8221;&nbsp; The answer should be obvious &#8211; the role of the traditional architect has little place on an agile team.&nbsp; Most senior programmers on an experienced agile team can do much of the work that a traditional architect is typically tasked with.</p>
<p>The bulk of the balance of a traditional architect&#8217;s responsibilities are distributed to other roles on an agile team.&nbsp; Some of these roles aren&#8217;t even a part of a traditional team&#8217;s organization, or even a traditional team&#8217;s verbiage.&nbsp; However, not all of a traditional architect&#8217;s responsibilities are accounted for on an agile team, and as Sam pointed out, there&#8217;s still a need for someone in a technical leadership roll on an agile team no matter how much higher we perceive our programmers&#8217; design skills as compared to programmers on traditional teams.</p>
<p>On an agile team, programmers are more akin to a traditional team&#8217;s designers.&nbsp; If they&#8217;re not at the outset of agile adoption, they&#8217;ll be driven there sooner or later over a period that can last anywhere from a couple of months to a couple of years (depending on the predispositions of the programmer).&nbsp; Most of the traditional responsibilities of a traditional architect are taken on as a collaborative effort by an agile team&#8217;s senior technologists.&nbsp; The role of interfacing with the business is done by someone with technical and business knowledge who can in fact straddle the business/technology line.&nbsp; Even on traditional teams this isn&#8217;t always done by the architect.&nbsp; Even when it&#8217;s the architect&#8217;s stated responsibility to be the organizational interface point, he may not in fact be the right person for the job.</p>
<h3>An Agile Architect</h3>
<p>The traditional architect also has the responsibility of navigating the road forward &#8211; of scouting and plotting the course.&nbsp; Or as it was said in the dialog spurred by Sam&#8217;s post, to have an &#8220;overall vision of what a system should be.&#8221;&nbsp; Although on an agile team, an architect should also have a fine-grained vision for what the details of the implementation should be &#8211; putting in place expectations for patterns and tools supporting those patterns, and backing these up with a guiding value system for implementation, coding, and micro-design&nbsp;practices.</p>
<p>This means getting out in front of the pack in terms of technologies and timing the strike of new product and feature releases with the general availability of leading technologies that the team and the work product benefits from.&nbsp; In Sam&#8217;s case it means, among other things, to have been deeply knowledgeable of .NET before .NET even went to beta, to grok interop with legacy technologies to a greater depth than most, and to do the same thing all over again at the advent of advantageous technologies coming in the WinFX wave and beyond.</p>
<p>On an agile team, it&#8217;s the architect&#8217;s responsibilities to guide the team to new technologies and new approaches &#8211; and it means unequivocally doing this from right there in the common workspace, shoulder-to-shoulder with the rest of the team.&nbsp; Even if it means working side-by-side with coders.&nbsp; On an agile team, an architect is in fact a coder.&nbsp; The only people on an agile team who might not regularly code are the customer and the ScrumMaster.&nbsp; Everyone else gets an IDE &#8211; and not just the fancy Visual Architect version that may or may not ship with an actual compiler.</p>
<h3>Building Frameworks During Agile Projects</h3>
<p>An agile architect also provides technical frameworks that keep the team in the intended groove &#8211; and yes, this can even mean building frameworks in the course of an agile project &#8211; as long as there&#8217;s a customer-approved card for it, and as long as it&#8217;s built micro-incrementally.</p>
<p>The frameworks should find their justification in the system&#8217;s code and in best scenarios should be extracted from existing code.&nbsp; An agile architect is a gifted abstractionist who can sense abstractions through intuition and who can craft frameworks to extend the usefulness of these abstractions to the team.</p>
<p>He should be forward-thinking when implementing frameworks, and should be able to temper his forward thinking with agile development values like DTSTTCPW and to an extent, YAGNI.</p>
<p>Abstraction is a sixth sense.&nbsp; Not everyone has it, not everyone is good at at, and not everyone is interested or aware of it.&nbsp; An agile architect caries the concretions of abstractions into the team and into the code by doing the actual coding work himself.</p>
<p>Many frameworks growing out of traditional projects die on the vine while frameworks emerging from agile projects are typically already potentials living in a system&#8217;s codebase waiting to be surfaced.&nbsp; An agile architect senses the abstractions, refines them with his own hands, and re-integrates them into an application&#8217;s codebase again with his own hands, shoulder-to-shoulder with his team mates.</p>
<h3>Participation isn&#8217;t Optional</h3>
<p>On an agile team, the architect has a duty to participate as coder.&nbsp; He must be up to his elbows in the code that will make use of any frameworks that he builds, and the code that implements any technical plan that he has crafted or approved.&nbsp; He must be in the code to keep watch for divergences from the plan that signal either degradations in design or new design opportunities.</p>
<p>This can&#8217;t be done from behind a closed door.&nbsp; An agile architect is right there in the thick of things.&nbsp; He&#8217;s as capable of ivory tower thinking as he is down-to-the-metal application coding.&nbsp; His skills are lost if they aren&#8217;t constantly tested by, mixed with, and even augmented by the programmers that he serves.&nbsp; And therein lies the essential difference between what I&#8217;ve seen as architects on agile teams and traditional architects:</p>
<p>An agile architect <i>serves</i> his team.&nbsp; That&#8217;s one heck of a hard position to hold down consistently.&nbsp; The balance of power on an agile team isn&#8217;t the same as it is on traditional teams, otherwise it would likely detrimentally impact the extent of collaboration needed to achieve agile&#8217;s lauded successes.&nbsp; When things get hot and heavy in the war room, there&#8217;s no mahogany door to hide behind, and there&#8217;s not much of an eminent domain to invoke.</p>
<h3>Playing the Command and Control Trump Card</h3>
<p>Even though agile teams are self-organizing, deep democracies, it&#8217;s the agile architect&#8217;s role to break dead-locks on contentious design and process issues.&nbsp; This very rarely needs to be done with an iron first.&nbsp; If the team doesn&#8217;t already recognize the architect&#8217;s authority and responsibility over final design decisions, then it&#8217;s going to be hard to stick to a plan that might be predicated on subtleties that are beyond even the most senior programmers&#8217; understandings.</p>
<p>Sometimes the command and control trump card has to be played.&nbsp; Most agile teams will <i>almost</i> never run into situations like this, but it&#8217;s gotta be done when it&#8217;s gotta be done.&nbsp; Even though agile teams are organizationally flat, it&#8217;s easier for someone to make final-call decisions when he has a mandate to do so.</p>
<p>The absence of the recognized tie-breaker and deal-maker on an agile team can ultimately lead to detrimental effects on the quality of the design.&nbsp; Agile&#8217;s particular flavor of design-by-committee is usually sufficient for a skilled team, but traditional management practices are still in play, and sometimes they&#8217;re even used.</p>
<h3>Big Brother</h3>
<p>Code reviews are good, and so we do them all the time.&nbsp; This is what XP is after with pair programming.&nbsp; That said, an agile architect should also be taking the time to sample a system&#8217;s code as it progresses through the project and nip in the bud anything that is tending to fall outside of the architectural value system.</p>
<p>This could seem to be like a bit of a Big Brother role, and it is, in effect.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not the George Orwell kind of Big Brother though, but more of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brothers_Big_Sisters_of_America" target="_blank">Irvin Ferdinand Westheimer</a>&nbsp;kind of Big brother.</p>
<h3>Microsofticus Architectimonius Disgustus &#8211; Hopefully a Species in Decline</h3>
<p>Having experienced the stark difference of the practices and attitudes of architects on traditional teams versus those on agile teams, I&#8217;m biased toward the (sometimes difficult) investment in reality made by agile architects.</p>
<p>Part of the reason is the deep disgust I have for the retired-in-place and attitudes that many traditional architects hold as sacred and sovereign to the practice of architecture and the society of traditional architects.&nbsp; And although Microsoft culture is finally starting to show some signs of catching up with the Java world in regards to process and practices, it remains a great bastion for decadence and decay that is at the core of some of the most detrimental forces acting on the Microsoft developer community in regards to progression toward practice maturity.&nbsp; If I were a traditional architect in the Microsoft space, I might be a bit nervous too, considering that an average senior developer on an average agile team could likely fulfill 90% of a traditional architect&#8217;s responsibilities without the requirement of such a high-falutin&#8217; title.&nbsp; An architect on an agile team isn&#8217;t merely a senior developer who has wallowed in enough professional lethargy to have gained enough seniority at a single company to have slept his way to the architectural golden handcuffs.</p>
<p>One of the most disgusting displays of decadent deterioration in the Microsoft architecture profession that I&#8217;ve seen took place at a Microsoft MVP Global Summit in Redmond.&nbsp; One night during the week, MVP&#8217;s and their product teams get together for a social mixer.&nbsp; These events are usually segmented along product divisions at Microsoft, and the developer division MVP&#8217;s were invited to a joint event hosted by the developer division product groups.</p>
<p>You might think that this event would also include the Solution Architect MVP&#8217;s, but they were elsewhere &#8211; at a wine tasting if I remember correctly.&nbsp; Off they scuttled in their leather-elbow-patch reinforced architecture blazers trailing behind them the stink of cliquishness that believes deeply in its own sovereign right to not have to mix with the great unwashed developer masses.&nbsp; God forbid such an architect allow his Stone Cutters ring to be kissed by such mere lips.</p>
<p>In the world of software architecture, these are the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountainhead#Peter_Keating" target="_blank">Peter Keatings</a> of the profession.</p>
<h3>Pathfinder</h3>
<p>Even though I&#8217;ve been &#8220;doing&#8221; <i>acts of architecture</i> for some years, I&#8217;m reticent to put on the blazer and go to the wine tasting &#8211; at least not while I&#8217;m at work.&nbsp; The closest that I&#8217;ve come to taking on the title was when I went to work for a Microsoft RD who taught &#8220;enterprise&#8221; ASP .NET courses that used static methods at the data access component boundaries.&nbsp; I chose to have &#8220;Abstractionist&#8221; printed on my card instead.&nbsp; Today, I would probably choose the title, &#8220;Pathfinder&#8221;.</p>
<p>Because so much design work and trust is shifted into the center of an agile team, an architect&#8217;s role on an agile team is often more one of path-finding than wine tasting.</p>
<p>A pathfinder is a leader and a scout.&nbsp; He&#8217;s a teacher and a participant.&nbsp; He&#8217;s a professional learner.&nbsp; He pursues mastery of the process and the tools as well as the practices and patterns.&nbsp; He&#8217;s in constant pursuit of self-betterment and knowledge.&nbsp; He hasn&#8217;t retired to a closed office with&nbsp;<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/teamsystem/products/arch/default.aspx" target="_blank">drag and drop architecture tools</a>.</p>
<p>To me, a pathfinder is part architect and part bhodisatva.&nbsp; To an extent, I&#8217;ve been averse to being professionally reborn as an architect &#8211; at least not until the stigma of architecture stemming from the decadence of traditional software methodologies has faded into history.&nbsp; Till then, I&#8217;m comfortable being a pathfinder, and continuing to fulfill an architect&#8217;s role on projects staffed with a team of agile programmers who themselves are pursuing ever deeper skills and understanding of the software world.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Software creationalism is a flavor of software development that is inordinately, irresponsibly, and often destructively concerned with the initial creation of an application&#8217;s code.</p>
<p>Tool vendors &#8211; especially in the Microsoft space &#8211; target software developers with a barrage of presentations on the wonders of wizards, drag and drop data-binding, smart tags, application generators, etc.&nbsp; These kinds of things are aimed at going from having no code, to having as much code as possible, and to do so with very little micro-iterative practice in play.</p>
<p>Software creationalism is almost entirely a tool vendor&#8217;s game &#8211; and it&#8217;s not a game whose intension is to benefit tool users.&nbsp; Software creationalism is about bloated IDE&#8217;s and code generators.&nbsp; It&#8217;s about how to distract users from critical issues in software development and keep them mesmerized with the smoke-and-mirror veneer of software creation tools.</p>
<p>The vast majority of the costs associated with a software project are in maintenance.&nbsp; Why all the focus on the creation phase?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s much easier to sell software creation tools than software maintenance tools.&nbsp; After all, you&#8217;d first have to undo years of perception bending of Microsoft customers toward the irrational and unfathomable fixation on software creation.&nbsp; And with so much predilection built up over the past ten years toward whiz-bangy software creation flashing lights, sparkly things, and bells and whistles, you&#8217;d almost certainly have to make software maintenance tools that pander to this visual sensationalism.&nbsp; Interestingly, a tool like <a href="http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/IDETools/Refactor/" target="_blank">Developer Express Refactor</a> seems to have been doing good things in this context (although <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">JetBrains ReSharper</a> still has my vote in regards to raw practical power in line with agile development practices).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s desperately sad that software maintenance tooling and practice gets so little attention from the unwashed masses since it&#8217;s this area of focus where the greatest benefit can be had and the greatest progress toward sustainable software development success is made.</p>
<p>In this light, it&#8217;s hard to not cast Microsoft as an ethically incorrigible super villain in the world of software development.&nbsp; Microsoft has to keep its customers distracted from the real issues in software development since it doesn&#8217;t offer its customers practical options for developer tooling for software maintenance that aren&#8217;t overshadowed by its software creation tools.&nbsp; Furthermore, Microsoft&#8217;s developer guidance and even its architecture guidance is almost exclusively focused on keeping customer attention on software creation.</p>
<p>Microsoft doesn&#8217;t hold all the blame.&nbsp; The best we can do is to say that Microsoft is ethically-challenged.&nbsp; There&#8217;s no news there.&nbsp; Customers participate in this cycle as well.&nbsp; It&#8217;s through their own ignorance that they allow themselves to be taken to the cleaners.&nbsp; But, it&#8217;s an ignorance that is cultivated by Microsoft &#8211; which is ultimately very hard to turn a blind eye to.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a sickening kind of predation to bear witness to.</p>
<p>To be focused on software maintenance means to focus on those core concerns that ultimately gave rise to the agile software development practices.&nbsp; Software has to be changeable, and thus tested, and thus testable, and thus designed for testability.&nbsp; It should be built using inspective and adaptive processes.&nbsp; Its code must be literate and learnable to the extreme.&nbsp; The tools, languages, and frameworks used must be crafted with an understanding of micro-iterative development practices.</p>
<p>The tooling for software maintenance is mostly free and open source.&nbsp; The practices that support maintenance and sustainability can&#8217;t be communicated in the time that a mere tool can be learned.&nbsp; This is evidenced in the adoption of NUnit in absence of comparable adoption of&nbsp; Test-Driven Development; especially when the makers of NUnit have affirmed that the product roadmap for NUnit prefers features that benefit TDD versus features that benefit mere testing.&nbsp; Problematically, the subtler levels of practice where a number of the agile practices live are hard to even perceive until you&#8217;ve lived and worked there for a while.</p>
<p>The pay-offs for forcing your eyes from the seductive glow of software creationistic sensations is tremendous.&nbsp; The weaknesses in sustainability resulting from creationistic tools and practices are often either dramatically reduced, or eliminated altogether.</p>
<p>Software is only new for a very brief moment in time.&nbsp; Once a line of code has been committed to the screen it&#8217;s already in maintenance mode.&nbsp; You will spend vastly more time on average in changing that new line of code than you ever will have spent on creating it.&nbsp; To focus all of our efforts on mere software creation is to engage in negligence bordering on malpractice.&nbsp; To foster and encourage this kind of creationalistic thinking for one&#8217;s own benefit is simply unacceptable.</p>
<p>Software creationalism is all about short-term thinking.&nbsp; As long as you don&#8217;t expect your software to live longer than the time it takes to initially code it, creationalistic approaches will more than likely suffice.&nbsp; The real game in software is in maintenance and sustainability.&nbsp; We need to be looking to platforms, languages, tools, and frameworks that foster our ability to engage in sustainable development.&nbsp; Otherwise, we&#8217;re merely bringing the dog and pony show back to the office and trying to build an improbable future on it.&nbsp;</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Microsoft presently builds and markets its software development tools with the consideration of three principal developer personas: Mort, Elvis, and Einstein.&nbsp; And since these internally-intentioned marketecture artifacts leaked into the world at large, the Microsoft developer community seems to have sought not not validate them, but to at times inordinately identify with them.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nikhilk.net/" target="_blank">Nikhil Kothari</a> <a href="http://www.nikhilk.net/Personas.aspx" target="_blank">outlined the personas in a blog post</a> from January, 2004.&nbsp; Nikhil says:</p>
<fieldset>Mort, the opportunistic developer, likes to create quick-working solutions for immediate problems and focuses on productivity and learn as needed. Elvis, the pragmatic programmer, likes to create long-lasting solutions addressing the problem domain, and learn while working on the solution. Einstein, the paranoid programmer, likes to create the most efficient solution to a given problem, and typically learn in advance before working on the solution. In a way, these personas have helped guide the design of features during the Whidbey product cycle.</fieldset>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some developer personas might indeed use products the way that the usability folks Microsoft at Redmond suggest, but in a number of cases the mapping between persona, customer demographics, and feature focus are arbitrary and meaningless and have led to at times widely missed usability targets.&nbsp; In some cases the personas are accurate usability predictors for Microsoft&#8217;s developer tools, and in other cases, they&#8217;re more like wishful thinking than market science.&nbsp; The mapping of personas to Microsoft programming languages &#8211; Mort to VB, Elvis to C#, and Einstein to C++ &#8211; has caused a lot of debate and consternation in the Microsoft developer community.&nbsp; In some cases, these mappings don&#8217;t really hold water.&nbsp; There are Elvis types who use VB, and recently there has been an inflation in Mort developers using C#.</p>
<p>Whether the personas are appropriate or not, one thing is still certain: these are personas that Microsoft created for it&#8217;s own purposes in trying to arbitrarily segment a developer tools market such that it matches a convenient way to market VSTS to a world that Microsoft sees through waterfall-colored glasses.</p>
<p>Missing from the short list is a persona that depicts the Agile developer.&nbsp; This would be a good developer persona for Microsoft to address because it cuts across existing personas and sheds some light on the Mort/Elvis/Einstein artifice.&nbsp; The Agile developer also represents a growing population of developers who are out-growing the three principal Microsoft personas. Understanding the Agile developer would help Microsoft SKU wranglers shape a product line for today instead of one for two years ago.&nbsp; Getting with the Agile program might even help Microsoft achieve timeliness in innovation again and help unburden it from the bulk that keeps it from being able to effectively react to missed targets.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t account for the qualities of all Agilists everywhere, but here&#8217;s a stab at a persona if for nothing more than grins&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Hugo, the Agilist</b></p>
<p>Hugo has qualities of Mort and of Elvis, but he also has qualities that aren&#8217;t accounted for in Microsoft&#8217;s Three Devitos.</p>
<p>Both of Nikhil&#8217;s summations for Mort and Elvis apply to the Hugo persona.&nbsp; It might be said that, &#8220;Hugo, the opportunistic developer, likes to create quick-working solutions for immediate problems and focuses on productivity and learn as needed. Hugo, the pragmatic programmer, likes to create long-lasting solutions addressing the problem domain, and learn while working on the solution.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hugo opts to achieve both productivity and sustainability.&nbsp; In fact, Hugo achieves productivity through sustainability.&nbsp; These qualities are not antithetical under a methodology that allows for both of them to exist in the same workspace, kinda like the way that quantum physics allows for a particle to exist in multiple locations at the same time where it&#8217;s predecessor, Newtonian physics, does not.</p>
<p>He values courage, and so doesn&#8217;t behave much like the paranoid Einstein.&nbsp; He doesn&#8217;t believe that he can create the most efficient solution to a given problem regardless of the amount of learning in advance done before working on the solution.&nbsp; He uses evolutionary design and implementation practices supported by formal refactoring and regression testing so that he can begin to validate his design assumptions in code earlier rather than later, while still providing opportunities to change and refine the design at will as knowledge is gained.</p>
<p>Hugo is a developer who achieves sustainability through testability.&nbsp; Hugo designs for testability by using test-first programming approaches like Test-Driven Development and makes good use of testability patterns like Inversion of Control possibly supported by a Dependency Injection framework&nbsp;to escape the maintenance obstructions inherent in opaque object interactions inherent in typical RAD-tooled code.&nbsp; He has a significant facility with and knowledge of pragmatic project automation including automated testing, configuration management, automated build, and continuous integration tools.&nbsp; Hugo&#8217;s code is the team&#8217;s code and he uses a harmonized code style so as not to obstruct collective code ownership.&nbsp; He values communication and collaboration.&nbsp; More than likely, Hugo uses C#, but this is more likely due to Hugo&#8217;s Java roots than C or C++ roots.&nbsp; Hugo tests with a light-weight test framework rather than a heavy-weight debugger.&nbsp; He uses Domain-Driven Design patterns and practices to better codify and represent business knowledge in application code rather than using lack-luster domain-oriented technologies like Typed DataSets.</p>
<p>Mort is likely to use drag-and-drop features of Visual Studio to code the bulk of an application&#8217;s concerns.&nbsp; Elvis is is likely to add application logic to form code, but is just as likely to have a code library of business logic that the form makes use of.&nbsp; Hugo would likely only use drag-and-drop to do screen layout since using Visual Studio&#8217;s RAD tools inappropriately would foster opacity, and inhibit testability to the extent that Hugo expects.&nbsp; Hugo builds user interface code using the Model-View-Presenter pattern, eschewing opacity by moving UI application logic out of a form&#8217;s code-behind file into a more testable class.</p>
<p>Hugos can achieve more maintainability through practiced testability design, Agile testing, and communication than Mort might achieve through RAD tooling since RAD is focused on short-term implementation issues.&nbsp; RAD helps the novice get today&#8217;s tasks done today with a minimum of concern paid to the cost to sustainability that typical RAD approaches bring.&nbsp; Hugo optimizes sustainability through design to keep obstructions and code debt from impacting productivity over the entire lifespan of the project or product.&nbsp; Mort or Elvis&#8217; productivity would decelerate as the RAD tooling introduced more duplication and inconsistency as defects and change requests are addressed over the lifespan of the project or product.</p>
<p>Both Mort and Elvis are likely to write tests <i>after</i> writing functional code.&nbsp; Hugo considers testability as a primary design concern and optimizes for success in this area by engaging in Test-Driven Development.&nbsp; In order to achieve secure software, we design for security.&nbsp; In order to achieve software that scales, we design for scalability.&nbsp; If we merely tack on testing at the end of development we end up in the same kind of situation when we tack on security and scalability as an after-thought.&nbsp; Hugo achieves clean design by focusing on testability because testable designs are identical to loosely-coupled designs of reusable classes.</p>
<p>Hugo is likely to opt for open source tooling over Visual Studio Team Foundation and Team System since these tools don&#8217;t add much of significance to measurable quality that can&#8217;t already be had from the light-weight open source tools, and they are&nbsp;significantly more costly to acquire and continue to operate than the open source tools that inspired them.</p>
<p>Hugo understands that test coverage is a fickle metric; that&nbsp;one can have 100% coverage and still have a lot of defects.&nbsp; Rather, he pays attention to defect rates and Cyclomatic Complexity in his code, and is assured of high test coverage numbers because that&#8217;s a small part of what Test-Driven Development delivers largely as a side effect.</p>
<p>Hugo quite possibly represents the next logical phase in software developer evolution <img src='http://codebetter.com/scottbellware/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

				<p>Test-Driven Development&#8217;s &#8220;Red, Green, Refactor&#8221; mantra is a mnemonic shorthand for TDD&rsquo;s development process.</p>
<p>Following Test-Driven Development, a developer first writes a<br />
failing test, then makes the test pass, and then writes the functional<br />
code that the assertions of the test are meant to lock in.</p>
<p>This is an overly simplistic view of TDD, but it&#8217;s a level of<br />
understanding that many folks never really see beyond.&nbsp; If you<br />
stop at such a shallow understanding of TDD, you&#8217;ll probably end up<br />
scratching your head and wondering what all the fuss is about.&nbsp;<br />
Again, &#8220;Red, Green, Refactor&#8221; is a mnemonic.&nbsp; The richness of TDD<br />
isn&#8217;t in the mnemonic, it&#8217;s in the details.</p>
<p>Here is the TDD development process at a glance as oft-quoted in the software development community at large:</p>
<p>1. Write a test</p>
<ul>
<li>Think about how you would like the operation in your mind to appear in code
</li>
<li>Invent the API you wish you had (in case you missed it, this is software design, not software testing)
</li>
<li>Include all the elements in the story that you imagine will be necessary to calculate the right answers
</li>
<li>Write the test to fail</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Make it run</p>
<ul>
<li>Quickly getting the test to pass dominates everything else
</li>
<li>If a clean simple solution is obvious, type it in
</li>
<li>If the clean, simple solution is obvious but will take a<br />
minute, make a note of it and get back to the main problem &ndash; making the<br />
test pass </li>
<li>Quick test success excuses all sins, but only for the moment&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p>3. Make it right</p>
<ul>
<li>Now that the system is behaving, put the sinful ways of the recent past behind you
</li>
<li><i>&ldquo;Step back onto the straight and narrow path of software righteousness&rdquo;</i> (Beck)
</li>
<li>Refactor (remove duplication)</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;Red, Green, Refactor&#8221; is analogous to the The Karate Kid&#8217;s, &#8220;wax on, wax off&#8221;.</p>
<p>in the movie, &#8220;The karate Kid&#8221;, Mr. Miyagi drills some karate moves<br />
into Daniel Larusso&#8217;s muscle memory by finding a way for Daniel to<br />
repeat the movements without focusing on the fact that he&#8217;s &#8220;doing&#8221;<br />
karate.&nbsp; At the time, Daniel thinks that his new mentor is simply<br />
taking advantage of him as free labor until Miyagi shows Daniel that<br />
the &#8220;wax on, wax off&#8221; motions are in fact the motions for blocking an<br />
attack.&nbsp; Miyagi habituated Daniel to the motions by having him use<br />
the motions to wax Miyagi&#8217;s small fleet of classic cars.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s more to &#8220;Red, Green, Refactor&#8221; than meets the eye, just as<br />
there is more to &#8220;wax on, wax off&#8221; than meets the eye.&nbsp; The<br />
question is whether the petitioner has the discipline to drill the<br />
practice until it is second nature.</p>
<p>TDD is a practice.&nbsp; It&#8217;s something that requires some drilling<br />
at the outset.&nbsp; TDD isn&#8217;t a tool, and there&#8217;s no magic want that a<br />
teacher can wave over your head to transfer practice and knowledge into<br />
you.&nbsp; TDD is software Kung Foo.&nbsp; You&#8217;re not going to get it<br />
by reading comic books or and sitting vegetatively on your ass in front<br />
of an XBox.&nbsp; On the upside, it&#8217;ll take much less time to become<br />
proficient in TDD than to become proficient with Miagi Do Karate (not<br />
considering the karate kid&#8217;s ability to become a champion fighter in<br />
the spaces of a few weeks).</p>
<p>At first, exercising the TDD process will take up a lot of<br />
attention.&nbsp; Developers spend a lot of attention on keeping to the<br />
test-first way of doing things, and little attention is spent on<br />
becoming aware of the changes to software deign that occur by engaging<br />
in test-first programming.</p>
<p>At this stage, TDD practice may seem as meaningful and fruitful as<br />
waxing cars did to Daniel&#8217;s karate training.&nbsp; You might be tempted<br />
to quit, and it&#8217;s at this stage that most undisciplined developers<br />
abandon their TDD practice and abandon themselves to their previous<br />
pathetic programming proclivities.</p>
<p>Part of penetrating the seeming frivolousness of Test-Driven<br />
Development&#8217;s practice is getting to an understanding of why we start<br />
with a failing test, and follow up the failing test that doesn&#8217;t really<br />
validate the code in any serious way.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not valuable to simply accept the TDD dogma at face value and<br />
expect that you&#8217;ll to keep at your practice faithfully until the &#8220;Red,<br />
Green, Refactor&#8221; lights come on.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a darn good reason for<br />
starting with a failing test, moving on to a simple passing test, and<br />
then getting down to writing real functional code.</p>
<p>Tests are instruments of measurement.&nbsp; They measure the<br />
correctness of functional code and prove that functional code has no<br />
defects.&nbsp; But there&#8217;s an inherent problem with tests&#8230; they are<br />
made with the same raw material that functional code is made of and<br />
subsequently they are subject to the same defects.&nbsp; Put another<br />
way, if you are using code to prove that some other code doesn&#8217;t have<br />
any bugs, what&#8217;s to say that the test code itself doesn&#8217;t have any<br />
bugs?&nbsp; How do you prove that the test code is defect-free?</p>
<p>You can write a defective tests just as easily as you can write<br />
defective code.&nbsp; The tricky thing with defective code is that it&#8217;s<br />
likely that you won&#8217;t simply catch the defect by reading the<br />
code.&nbsp; You know this to be true because you&#8217;ve often sat down to<br />
fix a defect and stared at it for some time before you realize what the<br />
defect is.&nbsp; Defects can sit right under your nose and not even be<br />
detected.&nbsp; Your ability to catch a defect can depend on all kinds<br />
of external influences &#8211; how much sleep you&#8217;ve had, how many<br />
distractions are in your workspace, the composition of your new allergy<br />
medication, etc.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s so easy to write defective code, and thus defective test code,<br />
that TDD prescribes a disciplined process for writing tests that seeks<br />
to insulate you from the human frailties that are often the root cause<br />
of defective code to begin with, namely, programmer<br />
self-overestimation, and inattentiveness or distraction.</p>
<p>Measurement instruments often have to be calibrated before they can<br />
be used reliably.&nbsp; My desktop scanner came with a white balance<br />
sheet.&nbsp; The scanner&#8217;s software can be calibrated to an objective<br />
measurement of the color white by scanning the white balance<br />
sheet.&nbsp; Measurement instruments are calibrated to objective, known<br />
states.&nbsp; This calibration is what we&#8217;re doing by going through the<br />
Red and Green phases of the TDD development cycle.</p>
<p>By starting with a failing test, we are calibrating our software<br />
correctness measurement instrument, i.e.: our test, to a known failure<br />
state.&nbsp; This proves that the test detects an invalid state in the<br />
software under test and correctly reports the failure.&nbsp; We do this<br />
in the most simple way, often just returning a hard-coded invalid<br />
response from a method, or something equally simplistic.</p>
<p>Moving on to the green phase, we calibrate the test to a passing<br />
state.&nbsp; This proves that the measurement instrument can correctly<br />
detect and report that the software under test is working within its<br />
expected design parameters when it is functioning correctly.&nbsp; As<br />
with the failing test, we cause the test to pass with very simple code,<br />
often returning a hard-coded valid response from a method.</p>
<p>We never calibrate tests using real functional code.&nbsp; Real<br />
functional code might pass or fail for reasons that aren&#8217;t<br />
predictable.&nbsp; For example, the functional code may have a<br />
defect.&nbsp; If you calibrate test code against defective functional<br />
code, you haven&#8217;t actually calibrated you test at all.&nbsp; In fact,<br />
if you calibrate against defective functional code, you risk<br />
introducing even more defects into your codebase since you will believe<br />
that the calibrated test is in fact a reliable measurement instrument<br />
when in fact, it won&#8217;t provide you with reliable measurements at<br />
all.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t calibrate the white balance of my scanner by feeding<br />
it a page of my local newspaper since this would give the scanner<br />
incorrect information to base its color offset algorithm on.</p>
<p>We need to start the refactoring phase of the TDD cycle with<br />
reliable, calibrated tests because we are ultimately going to be<br />
incrementally introducing small changes into the codebase and with each<br />
small change we will execute the calibrated test to make sure that we<br />
are still on track.&nbsp; We follow this process whether we&#8217;re<br />
introducing a new bit of code, or if we&#8217;re introducing a change to some<br />
existing code.&nbsp; The process is always the same &#8211; create an<br />
unquestionably calibrated test, and then introduce the functional code<br />
in small increments.</p>
<p>Many small increments of change are used because it&#8217;s easier to tell<br />
at any stage whether the last bit of code you wrote broke the<br />
code.&nbsp; When a test fails, we fix the code immediately.&nbsp; If<br />
you introduce change in big chunks, it&#8217;s harder to figure out exactly<br />
which new bit of code from that larger chuck of work is actually<br />
responsible for breaking the code.&nbsp; When you code in large chunks,<br />
you end up spending more time coding as you&#8217;ll spend more time figuring<br />
out what went wrong when something goes wrong.&nbsp; Invariably, you&#8217;ll<br />
need to use the debugger to figure this out. Developers with a TDD<br />
practice spend much less time debugging code, and much more time<br />
writing code and refactoring code toward its inherent, optimal design.</p>
<p>Debugging code is a slow, time consuming process.&nbsp; Time spent<br />
in a debugger is sloth time.&nbsp; You might be thinking that you&#8217;re<br />
perfectly effective in a debugger and that you don&#8217;t have any<br />
objections to doing code validation in a debugger rather than in a<br />
well-factored unit test.&nbsp; This is merely an assumption fed by how<br />
habituated you are to using a debugger.&nbsp; Without having a TDD<br />
practice, you have no basis of comparison for how ineffective debugging<br />
is compared to writing well-factored unit tests for well-factored code.</p>
<p>Arriving at a solid understanding of why TDD insists on starting<br />
with a failed test, and then making the test pass will go a long way to<br />
helping you internalize the necessity of the TDD process.&nbsp; The<br />
unit test is the force driving the design of your functional code; or<br />
the &#8220;factoring&#8221; of your functional code.&nbsp; The unit test must be as<br />
defect-proof a possible before we put our trust in it as the single<br />
most influential aspect of our coding and detailed software design<br />
practice.</p>
<p>Understanding why we calibrate the test doesn&#8217;t explain how to calibrate the test, and how to do so effectively.</p>
<p>You can still do things during the calibration of your test that by<br />
and large don&#8217;t really serve to calibrate the test as much as they do<br />
to provide you with an illusion of having a calibrated test.</p>
<p>For example, you can fail a test by throwing an exception from the<br />
method under test.&nbsp; If the method under test is never expected to<br />
throw an exception, then this would be an entirely inappropriate way to<br />
calibrate the&nbsp; test.</p>
<p>The first part of the TDD cycle where a failing test is written<br />
should be stated, &#8220;write a meaningfully failed test,&#8221; or &#8220;fail the test<br />
meaningfully.&#8221;</p>
<p>If a method is expected to return an integer that is greater than 0,<br />
then fail the test by having the method under test return -1.&nbsp;<br />
Returning -1 from the functional method is in keeping with actual<br />
functional behavior that would be considered invalid and that the test<br />
should detect and report as a failure.&nbsp; Throwing an exception from<br />
the method under test will indeed cause the test to fail, but not in a<br />
way that is within the design expectations of the method, and therefore<br />
the test won&#8217;t have actually been correctly calibrated toward detecting<br />
a real invalid state.</p>
<p>With this in mind, here is a restatement of the first step of the<br />
TDD process, slightly modified to disambiguate the knowledge that TDD<br />
practitioners often take for granted:</p>
<p>1. Write a test</p>
<ul>
<li>Think about how you would like the operation in your mind to appear in code
</li>
<li>Invent the API you wish you had
</li>
<li>Include all the elements in the story that you imagine will be necessary to calculate the right answers
</li>
<li>Write the test to fail <b>meaningfully</b></li>
</ul>

				<p>The poop has hit the propeller for Microsoft over the past few days in regards to its <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182521.aspx" target="_blank">Guidelines for Test-Driven Development article</a> published on its Microsoft Developer Network portal (MSDN).</p>
<p>Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a well-defined software design method that focuses on facilitating testability through loose coupling. The loose coupling arrived at by TDD fosters better class factoring and subsequently enables vastly improved opportunities for reuse harvesting. In addition, Test-Driven Development teaches software developers who are relatively weak in object-oriented (OO) programming and design how to use OO techniques and provides clear guidance for the employment of design patterns. I can&rsquo;t imagine another method that offers as much to software developers as TDD does in terms of effective design, extraordinary increases in software quality, and OO learning. </p>
<p>On Test-Driven Development and Agile, Microsoft seems to have has lost its way, lost its courage, and lost its ability to innovate.&nbsp;By missing the Agile boat, Microsoft is missing a key opportunity to transition millions of legacy developers to the .NET platform through the enhanced OO learning offered to developers who engage in Agile development practices. Microsoft is missing even more opportunities to rapidly adapt its software development tools to emerging requirements in contemporary software development because Microsoft isn&rsquo;t yet harnessing the power of the adaptive design and delivery enjoyed by those developers and shops that engage in Agile software development. </p>
<p>Faced with a critical decision of innovation over stagnation, Microsoft has cowered into the old familiar waterfall approaches that ensure that its customers are capable only of repeatedly investing money hand over fist into efforts that produce utterly disposable software. The practice guidance for Visual Studio 2005 reeks of outdated software development practices, and the Guidelines for TDD article is a shining example of how smelly things can really get. </p>
<p>A clear distinction needs to be drawn between mere test-first programming and Test-Driven Development. This is a point that is largely lost on most developers new to TDD &ndash; and by &ldquo;developers new to TDD&rdquo; I mean those for whom the TDD lights still haven&rsquo;t come on. For me this period of darkness lasted for over a year after I had read Kent Beck&rsquo;s book on the subject. For over a year, I had assumed that I knew what TDD is and I had assumed that I was practicing it. Imagine my surprise when I realized that there was more &ndash; much more &ndash; to TDD than I had assumed. </p>
<p>Reading the main Test-Driven Development forum on Yahoo Groups, there was a lot of talk on a lot of esoteric software stuff that was way over my head. Originally, I thought that all this esoteric stuff was just stuff that applied to Java developers, since at the time, most of the TDD people were Java developers along with a smattering of people using C++. Over time, it became apparent to me that these esoteric issues in software design were essential aspects of object oriented design and are equally applicable to .NET, and it was through TDD that I learned that I had totally overestimated my knowledge of OO. </p>
<p>It was also through TDD practice that I learned one heck of a lot about OO, design patterns, component design, and application design and architecture. TDD practice puts learning in high gear and keeps it there. Of course, if you don&rsquo;t think that learning is part of your job as a software developer, then TDD is probably not for you. And this might be the message that Microsoft is sending out regarding the kind of software people that far too many .NET developers have devolved into. </p>
<p>Rather than shape up Visual Studio to be amenable to Test-Driven Development, and in its ignorance of the nature of Test-Driven Development, Microsoft&rsquo;s marketing people have simply tried to snow job the developer community into swallowing a wholly different definition of Test-Driven Development. And the very text outlining Microsoft&rsquo;s understanding of Test-Driven Development betrays its almost complete ignorance of why Test-Driven Development is effective and why it is practiced in the way that it is. </p>
<p>So, this is for the folks at MSDN. Listen up&hellip; you&rsquo;ve already embarrassed yourself once, and you&rsquo;ve embarrassed your insider and MVP communities by association this time as well. So here&rsquo;s more of the skinny on TDD: </p>
<p>TDD is a software design methodology. It&rsquo;s not a software testing methodology. As such, a guidelines for TDD document doesn&rsquo;t belong in the MSDN content tree for VSTS for Testers &ndash; it&rsquo;s a topic for developers. TDD arrives at its design values by considering client code first before considering server code. It uses tests to act as clients because it&rsquo;s vastly cheaper and faster to code a test method than to build an entire visual application to incrementally implement and validate a design intention. Because tests are used as client code in the process of client-driven design, we arrive at the end of any given development cycle with tests in hand. And in using tests as clients, we learn a lot more about the needs of testability, and how to factor our class libraries so that internals that would traditionally be hidden way down in the dark, buried branches of code are surfaced through design patterns and exposed directly to tests. This in turn leads to more simple test classes and thus to greatly facilitated maintenance. The smaller class factoring and the structural decoupling of these smaller classes via interfaces (and sometimes abstract classes) allow these assets to be more easily harvested for reuse. And the emergence of the justification for OO practices like polymorphism and adaptation demonstrates to even the most novice OO developer where and why to use design patterns, and which design patterns to use. </p>
<p>Oh yeah, and because we base our tests on a well-known test frameworks like those in the xUnit family (like VSTS), we also use our design scaffolding as a regression test suite, further ensuring the sustainability of our codebases. </p>
<p>Testing is a side effect. Design is the goal of TDD, design for testability flows naturally from there, followed by de-coupling, and reusability. TDD is a king among contemporary software design practices. It delivers on so many measures of software development goodness. </p>
<p>You simply cannot achieve the aims of Test-Driven Development if you start with sweeping assumptions of the structure of classes before you set down the kind of code that incrementally validates your assumptions. </p>
<p>If a developer leaps to conclusions about design of a class or family of classes, he will have missed the optimal design of the class. As the implementation of a class deviates from its inherent optimal design, implementation and maintenance costs for that class increase exponentially as the effort to cajole misshapen classes together into a system of misshapen classes increases. This increase in cost an effort is compounded by the number of classes in a system. Most codebases can&rsquo;t sustain this pressure for too long and they are often disposed of and re-written entirely from scratch &ndash; using the exact same development methodologies that caused them to degenerate into entropy to begin with. </p>
<p>In TDD, you start with an understanding of what you need because scenario-based customer specification through stories or use cases tells you what you need. You write down a set of things that the software should do to satisfy a story, and you have the cajones to admit to yourself these things that you have written down are purely conjecture until you get them into code. We know that these things are conjecture because every developer learns about what he is coding from the first few lines of code he writes. As he writes more code, more is learned and previous assumptions are either ratified or disqualified and the code is morphed to address new understandings. We don&rsquo;t waste time on detailed design using any tool other than code because code is ultimately the only thing that can validate detailed design. Committing to the pursuit of detailed design in anything other than code leads to waste. Those design artifacts are ultimately invalidated by code and the artifacts are abandoned without ever having delivered sufficient ROI. </p>
<p>To quote Mary Poppendieck, &ldquo;Design is a knowledge-generating process,&rdquo; and because knowledge is continually generated during coding, then coding, as Jack Reeves pointed out long ago, is a design activity. </p>
<p>Coders are making design decisions with every method they implement. They do design whether they use Test-Driven Development approaches or not. Evolutionary design is the way that software is created. It&rsquo;s endemic to the medium. Software development is unlike any other kind of construction activity in this regard, and software development is like most forms of product development in this regard. </p>
<p>TDD simply supports the reality of software creation with a process and a set of techniques that are wholly optimized for the reality of creating software. Visual Studio on the other hand, is optimized for the reality that customers are still willing to believe in material solutions to problems that are essentially intellectual in nature, and Microsoft marketing folks are right there to sell snake oil to the gullible. </p>
<p>Should Microsoft be held responsible for selling lack-luster products into a market that is snuggly snoozing in a profound yet comforting sleep of epistemological ignorance? It damn well should be held responsible if it is not only going to sell software development tools, but also prop itself on a high horse and hold itself up in the community as a provider of software development practice guidance. If Microsoft cannot be trusted to do both and to do so with deep convictions to truth in advertising, then it needs to return to being merely a manufacturing company. </p>
<p>Ironically, the Agile development approaches that Microsoft so obviously eschews would have provided the company with the techniques that would have enabled it to provide support for Test-Driven Development in its own software development tools. Without the influence of Agile development techniques, Microsoft is doomed to continue to engage in building massive, monolithic, tightly-coupled products like Visual Studio that cannot be quickly adapted to meet emerging market pressures. </p>
<p>In the case of Test-Driven Development, the unit testing tools available in VSTS fall short of the mark, and leave the NUnit framework and Jamie Cansdale&rsquo;s Test-Driven.NET plugin for Visual Studio 2003 and 2005 to rule the roost as the leaders in tooling for Test-Driven Development for Visual Studio. That&rsquo;s not to say that Test-Driven Development isn&rsquo;t an interest for Microsoft. However, Microsoft&rsquo;s lack of foresight in identifying the need to support TDD in Visual Studio early enough in its Visual Studio 2005 product development cycle and its lack of agility in adapting to emerging requirements for tools to provide direct support for TDD once it had become aware of the need to support TDD have conspired to leave Microsoft little recourse at this late date. </p>
<p>In fact, members of Microsoft&rsquo;s insider community repeatedly asked for support for Test-Driven Development in Visual Studio 2005, and Microsoft was repeatedly publicly criticized for ignoring TDD requirements throughout its long beta and release candidate phase leading up to the RTM release of Visual Studio 2005 in early November. Microsoft is so utterly un-agile, that it isn&rsquo;t even able to respond to customer requirements that it had known about for a year and a half. And this is a company that purports to provide Agile development guidance to the software development community at large? </p>
<p>Ultimately, Microsoft caught on to the need to have a Test-Driven Development story for Visual Studio 2005 when it had already become too late for them to respond to the requirements. Well, too late for waterfall, anyway. So, at some point in recent history, Microsoft marketing folks made a bet that if they simply redefined Test-Driven Development so that it matched the existing tooling provided by Visual Studio 2005, they would be able to claim support for tooling requirements for contemporary software development techniques and approaches without actually having to worry about actually having that support in their tools. </p>
<p>Going with the assumption that the software development community at large is as ignorant and out-of-touch as the folks in Microsoft developer tools marketing in regards to contemporary software development, they simply posted the atrocious &ldquo;Guidelines for Test-Driven Development&rdquo; on MSDN. </p>
<p>Guidance provided in this article fundamentally contradicts some of the most essential and elemental practices and goals of TDD. If this guidance were to be put into practice, the practitioners would never glean the benefits promised by TDD. Because the guidance commits to neither waterfall nor to TDD, its fragmented nature almost guarantees that a practitioner of these guidelines be doomed to software hell. </p>
<p>In waterfall-style development, a developer starts with sweeping assumptions about a class&rsquo;s design and might capture them in a visual documentation tool like a class designer. If the developer were test-oriented (not Test-Driven mind you, but test-oriented), he might then code some test stubs. If he were using a powerful tool, the tool might generate the tests based on the code generated from the class design. </p>
<p>However, in doing so he would lock in his design at a point that is far too early in the development process. Wrapping so much test harness around so many non-validated design assumptions would likely cause those design assumptions to be fixed into place. Even if the developer had wanted to incorporate new knowledge into the design, there would be so many dependencies at such an early stage in the development that he might just as soon live with the junk he had just created. </p>
<p>This fixing of design assumptions in place too early in the process is one of the weaknesses of waterfall that TDD addresses quite effectively by providing practices that reinforce a very granular approach to incremental design and implementation. The approach is granular enough to allow understandings about the code under development to be taken into consideration immediately when these understandings emerge. </p>
<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s guidelines specifically recommend an approach that ensures that the failures of traditional software development will be upheld going forward into the age of VSTS: </p>
<blockquote><p>Step 6. Define the interfaces and classes for your feature or requirement. You can add a minimum of code, just enough to compile. Consider using the Class Designer to follow this step. </p>
<p>Step 7. Generate tests from your interfaces and classes. </p></blockquote>
<p>A more ignorant approach to TDD would have been hard to come up with. These steps in Microsoft&rsquo;s TDD guidance essentially describe nothing short of an anti-TDD process, and the whole document has the nerve to package up the guidance as factual TDD guidance. It&rsquo;s truly a shameful example of the worst product marketing behavior.</p>
<p>Microsoft has so overestimated its own understanding of TDD and the developer community that it has left itself open to criticism from some of the most notable figures in Agile development. </p>
<p>Robert Martin has this to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>Microsoft should pull these guidelines and try to figure out some way that the tool might actually support TDD. Redefining TDD as some kind of waterfall, just because their tool supports it that way, is not very helpful to the industry; and most programmers are all to clearly aware of this. If Microsoft would like to win the hearts and minds of more developers, they&#8217;d better try to figure out where the industry is actually going, rather than trying to drag the industry into it&#8217;s tool. IMHO they should look very carefully at Eclipse, and IntelliJ &#8212; especially IntelliJ.</p>
<p>Bottom line: We don&#8217;t need tools that help us do waterfall better. We don&#8217;t need vacuous process guidlines with 14 linear steps describing something that is not TDD while claiming otherwise. We don&#8217;t need to be force fed Visual Studio. What we need from Microsoft is for them to stop talking and listen. </p></blockquote>
<p>And from Michael Feathers:</p>
<blockquote><p>The style of TDD described in the guidelines would have us jump ahead and write five, ten, maybe twenty test cases before getting the first one to pass. You can do that, but it&#8217;s like putting on a set of blinders. When you don&#8217;t have to formulate the next test case right after passing the last one, there isn&#8217;t much chance to think about improvements. Worse, there is a disincentive to thinking about them: if you find any, you have to delete all of the speculation you&#8217;ve hardcoded in the tests and interfaces you created in advance.</p>
<p>Right now, I hope that MS revisits their guidelines. Yes, they have a tool that generates test stubs, but using it for TDD looks counter-productive. Adding stubs to legacy code? That would be great, but getting in the way of the feedback cycle? Bad. Bad. Bad.</p></blockquote>
<p>From Ron Jeffries:</p>
<blockquote><p>The original article, at msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182521.aspx, describes TDD as a process where you get all your requirements understood, then define all your tests, then design an object&#8217;s full interface, implement the tests, and make them work. It then goes on to explain how all these cool features in VSTS help with this &#8220;TDD&#8221; process.</p>
<p>The features might be good, but the process described is not TDD, nor a reasonable variation thereof. Test-Driven Development was clearly defined by Kent Beck, and has been described by others, such as Dave Astels, and even myself. It is a process where the tests are written one at a time (though one might make note of some possible tests for the future), and the tests are used to help define the design and develop the code. The Microsoft version of TDD is indistinguishable from a single-object waterfall model, to a first approximation. </p>
<p>Someone more paranoid than I am might conclude that Microsoft is intentionally trying to co-opt a perfectly good practice, pervert it, and tie it into mandatory use of their tools, which are, at this writing, about half as good as what&#8217;s available in Open Source and commercial plug-ins for Visual Studio. I prefer to assume that it&#8217;s just ignorance on their part, but I&#8217;m prepared to change my mind. </p>
<p>The article is shameful. If it isn&#8217;t intentionally malicious, it is at least ignorant and ill-conceived. It should be taken down and replaced with something that correctly reflects industry usage of the TDD terminology. </p></blockquote>
<p>From Sam Gentile: </p>
<blockquote><p>The Microsoft Guidelines for TDD are creating quite a storm of protest from people in the Agile community for very good reason. They don&#8217;t at all describe Test-Driven Development (TDD). They got it all wrong.</p></blockquote>
<p>From Jeremy Miller: </p>
<blockquote><p>No, no, no. Autogeneration of the unit tests from interfaces or classes might sound nice, but it isn&rsquo;t really correct and might not be all that useful. It&rsquo;s also not Test Driven Development. TDD is using unit tests to drive the design of the code. One of the &ldquo;crossing the Rubicon&rdquo; moments in learning TDD is when you learn to define the interface of a class inside the unit test. That&rsquo;s right, use the unit test to define the intended function of a new piece of code, and then write the code to make the unit test compile and pass (ReSharper will very happily create the method stub for you). I still do some paper and pencil work before coding, but by and large I&rsquo;ve found that I have better results when you are determining a class&rsquo;s signature while writing the unit tests. Writing unit tests first will inevitably simplify the usage of a class (because you&rsquo;ll want to minimize the mechanics of creating the unit tests). I certainly don&#8217;t think that you throw away traditional design techniques when you do TDD, but you can&#8217;t ever let the code and design get very far ahead of the unit tests.</p>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind with the autogeneration of unit tests is that unit tests do not map one to one with methods and properties. You don&rsquo;t test methods one by one. You test logical pathways through the code.</p>
<p>One of the key things to success in TDD is to very deliberately design for testability. The best way to accomplish testability is to write code &ldquo;Test First&rdquo;. If you design and create a lot of code before you switch to retroactively applying unit tests you&rsquo;ll often find that the unit tests are hard to write. Also, you will probably not achieve the same level of code coverage that you would if you code test first. Actually, let me put this more strongly &ndash; retrofitting existing code with unit tests is hard. It&rsquo;s perfectly acceptable to spend some time contemplating the design before coding, but do write the unit tests first. TDD will go so much better when you write the tests first.</p>
<p>My single biggest irritation with Microsoft&rsquo;s guidance to .Net developers and their development tools is Microsoft often seems to ignore anything outside of the Redmond campus. The advice they&rsquo;ve given is contrary to existing best practices for TDD that have resulted from experience. Patterns and Practices team, are you out there? I know you guys are using Agile methods because I read your blogs. Do y&rsquo;all really buy off on the MS TDD &ldquo;recommendations?&rdquo; Can you do something about this? </p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A number of TDD and Agile community folks have chimed in on this issue on the home base of TDD community at Yahoo Groups, ultimately driving curious traffic to the guidelines document. Overwhelmingly, people who have taken the time to rate the document have given it the lowest possible rating. As Michael Feathers pointed out about the article&rsquo;s rating on the TDD forum, it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;shame it&#8217;s asymptotic to 1.0.&rdquo; </p>
<p>On a related note, I will be teaching a <a href="/blogs/codebetter.com_events/archive/2005/11/14/134593.aspx" target="_blank">free, all-day workshop on Test-Driven Development in Houston on Tuesday, November 29th</a>. Ironically, the workshop will be held at The Microsoft Houston offices, but not to worry, I&rsquo;ll be presenting actual TDD, not the MSDN stuff.</p>
