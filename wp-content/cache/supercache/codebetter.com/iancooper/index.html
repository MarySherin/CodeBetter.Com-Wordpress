				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>First off, apologies for the delay in writing this one; I can only plead the pressures of work at the end of last year. There are a number of blogs, in the pipe, which I hope you can expect to see soon.</p>
<p>However, I had promised to update people on what happened at that last alt.net conference in the UK, specifically because we declared that it would be the last alt.net conference, feeling that movement had run its course. That outcome was reported on Twitter, but I wanted to go into why, and talk about some ideas for what is next.</p>
<p>Alt.Next took place on <a title="Alt.Next" href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/1014272717">19th\20th November 2010</a> and we were kindly hosted by <a title="Thoughtworks" href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/">Thoughtworks</a>. I gave the keynote on the condition, as I saw it on the state of the Alt.Net movement, something I have talked about <a title="Whither Alt.Net" href="http://codebetter.com/iancooper/2010/01/19/whither-alt-net/" target="_blank">here before on Codebetter</a>, but the history, as I saw it, is worth repeating here.</p>
<p><strong>A brief history of how the MS software community learned new ideas</strong></p>
<p>15 years ago, for the old hands amongst us, most our deep understanding came from books or from peers. There were rock star developers who we learned from. Just look at the Wrox publications of this period for the epitome of this rock star author movement with its, somewhat cringe-worthy, photos of geek celebrities embossed on its front covers. I can remember poring over copies of MFC Internals and Revolutionary Guide to MCF4 Programming with Visual C++.</p>
<p>But the problem was that knowledge was  ghettoized; most folks read the books they needed, and magazines like MSDN. There seemed to be very little cross pollination of ideas outside individuals moving jobs.</p>
<p>10 years ago, the Internet started to become a source of technical knowledge. Now there were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system">BBS</a> systems before this, but I don&#8217;t think they had the same reach. In my recollection, the real explosion here  corresponded with the emergence of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28software_platform%29">Java</a>. Java was cool and even places like The Well had Java forums where developers could gather and talk about this new language. It was either something to do with the paradigm shift caused by Java creating a new playing field, in which the old rock stars had to work to avoid looking like yesterday&#8217;s heroes, or the cross-fertilization as people from myriad former communities come together within Java; but somehow there seemed to be a greater sharing of knowledge. The masters were revealing their secrets to the journeymen and apprentices. It was a major shift in the availability of knowledge, and even books seemed to change to reflect that.</p>
<p>To my recollection this was the beginning of the first Windows Developer Diaspora. A lot of smart kids wrote leaving MS emails and forum posts and moved to Java. Plus ca change. Eventually MS reacted and moved to stop the diaspora with their own extensions to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jvm">JVM</a>, and following that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Language_Runtime">CLR</a>.</p>
<p>But the result of this explosion of knowledge, and the peering over the fence from some MS developers, looking to see what all this Java noise was about, led to a few of them encountering new ideas. New ideas like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping">ORMs</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_Control">IoC</a> containers. And some of them realized that the similarities between Java and C# gave them the ability to port some of these <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">OSS</a> projects into the .NET space to get the leg up on using them themselves.</p>
<p>In addition, as these MS developers looked to the Java community to understand best practices that might help them use their new frameworks, they stumbled across agile software engineering.</p>
<p>But&#8230;this cross fertilization did not seem to spread widely in the MS community. A lot of them were so busy fighting a rearguard action around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Foundation_Class_Library">MFC</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic">VB</a> that they already saw .NET as an invader, let alone ideas from other communities. I think they were afraid of the &#8216;promiscuous&#8217; behavior of.NET developers who flirted with these new ideas; they threatened the rock star developers dominion. And that frustrated those &#8216;promiscuous&#8217; developers who were excited by the possibilities of these new ideas, who saw a better, faster way of working. But without widespread understanding of these ideas, adoption was always a struggle, and these &#8216;promiscuous&#8217; developers became angry that no one was spreading the good news of the better way to their colleagues and managers, forcing them to work with impoverished tools and practices.</p>
<p>And I think it was in this context, that in 2008 a number of &#8216;promiscuous&#8217; MVPs gather at MVP summit. Many are folks you would recognize as current of alumni CodeBetter bloggers. They clustered together through shared beliefs that the .NET community was blind and deaf to other practices, frameworks and patterns, and that MS was happy to let them remain in the dark. Their anger coalesced around the Entity Framework, which was seen as a poor alternative to Nhibernate, or even LINQ to SQL for folks that wanted to work in a new way.</p>
<p>Because they were associated with the EF rebellion they became knows as the NHibernate mafia at first. <a href="http://laribee.com/altnet">But David Laribee gave them a new name, and a manifesto from hacker culture with Alt.Net</a>.</p>
<p>Some may feel the Alt.Net movement succeeded, some may feel it failed. However, awareness of agile software engineering ideas like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_%28object-oriented_design%29">SOLID</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a> is far greater, as our tools like ORMs or IoC containers. When MVC frameworks began their rise with Rails, the .NET community furnished Monorail and later MS produced ASP.NET MVC. Flawed or not, I think that the movement promulgated greater understanding of why these ideas were important. Now more and more people can work environments where these ideas can be pushed and adopted. So I think the Alt.NET movement achieved something, and I don&#8217;t think it should be regretted.</p>
<p>But of late the movement seems stalled. The question is what does that mean for the future of Alt.NET.</p>
<p><strong>Our Discussions</strong></p>
<p>A lot of the conversation on the day at Alt.Next can be centered around two perceived problems with the Alt.NET movement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Messianic.NET</li>
<li>The New Orthodoxy</li>
</ul>
<p>Many attendees brought stories of developers for whom Alt.NET was a negative moniker, applied to someone who is pushy and arrogant; with the implication that their ideas were somehow ivory-tower, not for us, and impractical. There was a feel that the &#8216;missionary&#8217; nature of the Alt.NET community had done more to offend that inform, and had often been too messianic. No one likes to be made to feel stupid, but the Alt.NET community made a lot of people feel that way.</p>
<p>The danger of the new orthodoxy can be summed up as the belief that Alt.NET is really just a set of tools. A TDD framework, an IoC container, an ORM, and an MVC web framework. Hence the question from outside: given decent versions of all those, isn&#8217;t the problem over &#8211; can&#8217;t Alt.NET just go away? Even deeper the problem seems to be that its not just generic versions of these tools but NHibernate over EF, anything over Unity, etc. that are required to prove your credibility to the movement. There even seems to be an orthodoxy that anyone not using R# is poor software developer who cares little for his craft. &#8220;By their works ye shall know them,&#8221; seems to be the mantra of this witch-hunt.</p>
<p>I think that none of the attendees believed that this was what Alt.NET had originally meant. Indeed David&#8217;s proposition had been: &#8220;It’s not the tools, it’s the solution&#8230;When tools, practices, or methods become mainstream it’s time to get  contrarian; time to look for new ways of doing things; time to shake it  up&#8221;.</p>
<p>And I think for my part, and many others is that whilst Alt.NET should now be about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL">NoSQL</a>, J<a href="http://goutamdey.com/2010/01/02/5-javascript-mvc-frameworks-2/">avascript MVC frameworks</a>, <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> etc. it seems mired in what was, not what is next, what we need to improve to be better. And in turn when those are done, it needs to move on.</p>
<p>And so we decided to abandon the Alt.NET moniker for future open space events.We want to move away from waging a war to spreading ideas. It is about cross-pollination with other communities, platforms. Going out to listen to other conversations and bringing that back into the .NET space. Innovating and taking those ideas out of the .NET space.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not even sure what the &#8220;new thing&#8221; should be called, or even if naming it matters, and is not a mistake. Perhaps Alt.NET is dead as a movement; others may still find it useful to identify the like minded, but whatever you want to call it, I think its important to embrace the manifesto that David outlined long ago over what it became in between:</p>
<p>&#8220;Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote “there are always two parties; the  establishment and the movement.” If you’re ALT.NET, you’re in the  movement. You’re shaking out the innovation. When the movement fails,  stalls, or needs improving you’re there starting/finding/supporting that  next leap forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>For our purpose though, Alt.NET is dead. I sing its praises, but its time to find the next leap forward.</p>
<p><strong>The New Diaspora</strong></p>
<p>One postscript is that once again we seem to be experiencing a diaspora. Once again ideas outside the community burn very brightly. Ideas that cannot simply be ascribed to tools but to approaches and practices. In this case I believe it is partly the OSS ecosystem that non-MS software communities support so much better. Perhaps our new movement will truly be born from a reaction to this crisis, as much as Alt.NET was to the last.</p>

				<p>I don&#8217;t usually do this kind of post, but following up on my comments in <a href="/blogs/ian_cooper/archive/2010/10/15/diverse-net.aspx">Diverse.NET</a> about the state of OSS in the community I thought it would be worth pointing out that the<a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-lucene-net-user/201010.mbox/browser"> Lucene.NET</a> project is<a href="http://codeclimber.net.nz/archive/2010/11/01/Lucene-Net-needs-your-help-or-it-will-die.aspx"> looking for help</a>. Anecdotally I know that a lot of people use Lucene.NET in London, so I suspect that situation is mirrored in the wider community. A lot of the love for Lucene.NET probably comes from its usage in <a href="http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2009/05/03/nhibernate-search-again.aspx">NHibernate Search</a>. <a href="http://ravendb.net/">RavenDB </a>uses Lucene.NET internally. Lucene (and related pieces like Solr) are &#8216;big beasts&#8217; in the search field, must as Hibernate is in the ORM field, and having a working port gives us easy access to this technology in the same way NHibernate gave us a first class ORM. So I think its an important piece of the ecosystem for us to support. For those looking for a little more <a href="http://sleepoverrated.com/">Scott Cowan</a> gave a presenation on Lucene at Skillsmatter that you can check out <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/open-source-dot-net/how-to-make-a-search-engine-with-lucenedot-net">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p> It&#8217;s probably worth reading through the thread on the mailing list archives to get a feel for the conversation there as to the direction the project is headed particularly this <a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-lucene-net-user/201011.mbox/browser">post</a>.</p>

				<p>Rob Conery has an&nbsp; interesting piece about <a href="http://blog.wekeroad.com/thoughts/making-bacon-from-lemonade">adopting an open source project</a> to encourage more OSS development in the .NET space. It is something we need. But I have one slight issue to pick with Rob&#8217;s comments. The .NET community didn&#8217;t wait 7 years for MS to implement it for us. <a href="/blogs/sebastien_lambla/archive/2010/10/15/building-polyglot-packages-for-openwrap-and-nupack.aspx">Seb </a>went out there and wrote <a href="http://github.com/openrasta/openwrap/wiki">OpenWrap</a>. What happened? Well it looks like outside the London .NET community folks were pretty much unaware of it it. Seb tried hard to publicize it, there is an interview about it on InfoQ back in <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2010/05/OpenWrap">May</a>. We hosted a session on it at <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/open-source-dot-net/packaging-with-openwrap">LDNUG</a>, and JetBrains sponsored an evening with a presentation at <a href="http://devconlondon.com/">DevCon London</a>. But it just never seemed to get the wider-audience it needed to break out of those closed circles. Many people looked at <a href="http://nu.wikispot.org/Front_Page">NuProj</a> as well. But even that project never seem to cross out of a small circle. (EDIT: And before that was <a href="http://code.google.com/p/hornget/">Horn</a> &#8211; thanks Paul &#8211; and even <a href="https://launchpad.net/coapp">CoApp</a>)</p>
<p>But MS entering the fray with <a href="http://nupack.codeplex.com/">nupack</a> has practically obliterated a &#8216;from the community&#8217; solution and created the 300ibs gorilla of an MS sponsored one. That may not be the &#8216;fault&#8217; of MS, their intent may be entirely good, but the road to hell is often paved with good intentions. By stepping in MS may have felt it was helping the community to resolve the issue. All it did was simply remove the ability of the community to solve the issue. I understand that nupack is set up as an OSS project, but by &#8216;doing it for us&#8217; they removed the community&#8217;s responsibility to solve the problem. So they have not aided the growth of community that addresses these issues. One of the hardest lessons to learn when leading or mentoring is to let others &#8216;do it for themselves&#8217; even if you could do it faster and sooner. Unless you give others the chance to try (and fail) you won&#8217;t get growth and you will always be doing it yourself.</p>
<p>The stark reality is this &#8211; the package management issue could have been resolved without MS help through OpenWrap (or NuProj). I don&#8217;t see significant technical advantage from NuPack over OpenWrap (it might win some adoption through a UI). I don&#8217;t know NuProj well enough to comment.</p>
<p>That would have given the opportunity for the community to understand it could solve its problems. If MS had publicized those OSS solutions with ASP.NET MVC 3 then it would have also given enormous publicity to community efforts to solve its own problems.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t, before anyone suggests that, want to denigrate the effort put in by the team working on NuPack. I just wish that it did not come with the wieght of being the MS solution to this issue.</p>
<p>What MS could have done was to call for folks to tell them about OSS package managers, worked with those projects to define some kind of open package standard, and then communicated to the wider development community what the standard was and who implemented it. For sure, if the community failed it might have helped to kickstart some projects with sample code, but by creating an MS solution, they pushed aside existing community efforts. I would like to think that the community gets behind the best package manager and that we chose between OpenWrap, NuPack or whatever based on what works</p>
<p>There does seem a lack of willingness within the .NET community to engage with a diverse ecosystem over a monoculture.In the long term this is not good for us. It does not drive the kind of innovation a successful development platform needs. A monoculture is no more positive for MS than others in this regard. I also think that the problem is sufficient that it does not only impact MS, but a lot of commercial outfits in the .NET space. I am sure there are shops that don&#8217;t use R# or CodeRush, because its not MS. There are plenty of commercial frameworks and libraries that would benefit from a widening of people&#8217;s purchasing choices. (And sure I would like a lot of tools and frameworks that are commercial to go open source and free for private use like <a href="http://ravendb.net/">RavenDB </a>or <a href="http://www.nservicebus.com/">NServiceBUS </a>and licensed for commercial, because I believe it is easier to make choices around something that you can try before buying and support if the vendor fails, but diversity is diversity regardless of the model).</p>
<p>Somehow we need to encourage more diversity in the .NET space, in tools, languages, people. I understand that it&#8217;s a big challenge. We need IronRuby and IronPython on the platform for that diversity. We need folks to understand that they could look&nbsp; Boo too. We need folks to understand there is not just ASP.NET MVC but <a href="http://trac.caffeine-it.com/openrasta">OpenRasta</a>, <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/MonoRail/">Monorail</a>, and <a href="http://wiki.fubumvc.com/Main_Page">FubuMVC</a>. We need folks to know not just about Entity Framework and LINQ-To-SQL, but also <a href="http://nhforge.org/Default.aspx">NHibernate</a>, <a href="http://www.subsonicproject.com/">Subsonic</a>, or even <a href="http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/ORM/">XPO</a>. It&#8217;s not about favoritism but creating an ecosystem in which different solutions can compete.</p>
<p>If Alt.Net was yesterday&#8217;s war cry maybe Diverse.NET is tomorrow&#8217;s.</p>
<p>The tragedy is that only MS probably has the reach to the .NET community to encourage engagement with an ecosystem over a monoculture. And as MS own the monoculture, can they be convinced it lies in their best interest to support it?</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>I have started to feel comfortable enough about our <a href="/blogs/ian_cooper/archive/2010/04/09/where-we-are-with-acceptance-testing-and-our-bdd-journey-today.aspx">BDD<br />
practice</a> to begin presenting on the techniques. <a href="http://lizkeogh.com/">Liz Keogh</a> came to my last<br />
presentation at London .Net Developers Group and suggested that I needed to<br />
look at <a href="http://www.limitedwipsociety.org/tag/feature-injection/">Feature<br />
Injection</a> as part of BDD practice now. Chris Matt&#8217;s comics are a good<br />
starting point for Feature Injection.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve not tried Feature Injection, but think its definitely worth a look for<br />
anyone using BDD. I&#8217;m keen to get a better understanding of how it might modify<br />
our &#8216;today&#8217; practice. This is just really some early notes on what I know now.</p>
<p><b>Stakeholder Stories<br /></b></p>
<p>Liz Keogh has a useful article on how sees the overall process of BDD when<br />
using Feature Injection over at <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/pulling-power">InfoQ</a>. The shift in<br />
how user stories are phrased seems to be one key to understanding this.<br />
Business Value is now being recognized as a key driver for why we are<br />
delivering a piece of work. So we re-phrase the classic Role-Goal-Motivation<br />
User Story as:</p>
<p>As a &lt;role&gt;</p>
<p>I want to &lt;goal&gt;</p>
<p>So that &lt;motivation&gt;</p>
<p>with </p>
<p>In order to &lt;achieve some outcome which<br />
contributes to the vision&gt;<br />
As a &lt;stakeholder&gt;<br />
I want &lt;some other stakeholder&gt; &lt;to do, use or be restricted by<br />
something&gt;</p>
<p>Liz calls these <i>stakeholder stories</i> to emphasize the difference from user stories.</p>
<p><b>Distilling the Vision</b></p>
<p>Notice how the outcome, the reference to the vision, why are we building<br />
this software now comes first over the goal. We emphasize that it is not enough<br />
to say what, but also to say why. How does this story help us meet the vision?<br />
When I talk about BDD I often shorthand it as &#8220;Build the right<br />
software&#8221; in comparison to TDD which helps us &#8220;Build the software<br />
right&#8221;. Feature Injection seems to take this process one step further by<br />
saying that it is not enough to restrict the developers to only building<br />
software that satisfies a specification, but also to ensure that those<br />
specifications are authored only for those stories that deliver on the vision.<br />
So where does the vision come from? In DDD terms the Vision results from the Distillation<br />
process. Identify the core domain and produce a Core Domain Vision statement.<br />
So the technique of Feature Injection reinforces DDD&#8217;s Distillation technique.<br />
Both Liz&#8217;s article and Chris Matt&#8217;s comics identify some standard techniques<br />
for helping to distil what is core domain from what is not. Given that vision<br />
the stakeholders then work to identify the broad features of what need to be<br />
delivered. User stories come from decomposing these features. </p>
<p>Our software lifecycle tends to begin with Iteration -1 in which the Big<br />
Plan, how we think we might build some software to satisfy a Vision is taken to<br />
sponsors. At that point we have only the results of Distillation (what DDD<br />
calls a Distillation document) and enough understanding of the Feature Set we<br />
need to provide a rough costing (folks want to know the order of the costs to<br />
understand whether the business value justifies the cost &#8211; software is an<br />
economic proposition). We then move to Iteration 0 or project Chartering, where<br />
we might capture initial stories and produce what Crystal calls an <a href="http://iancooper.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!844BD2811F9ABE9C!527.entry">Exploratory<br />
360</a>.</p>
<p>What I like most about Feature Injection at first reading&nbsp; is this<br />
explicitness with which it highlights what happens in Iteration -1 and<br />
Iteration 0. These are no longer &#8216;locked in the attic&#8217; in agile process terms,<br />
but brought to the fore as a vital part of the methodology. I have come across<br />
too many teams that have no idea about Iteration -1 or Iteration 0, push<br />
straight into Iteration 1 and build the wrong thing. So any process that<br />
highlights the need for this to occur gets a thumbs up from me.</p>
<p><b>What is Business Value</b>?</p>
<p>If we are suggesting that our focus is on business value, how do we assess<br />
value? Chris Matt&#8217;s admonition to focus on delivering business value over<br />
features is something about Feature Injection that I really warm to, as again<br />
and again we try to point to the fact that the most important metric for us is<br />
business value. In particular Feature Injection suggests &#8216;popping the why<br />
stack&#8217; until you can arrive at a definition of business value that meets Andy<br />
Poll&#8217;s advice that &#8216;A project creates business value when it increases or<br />
protects revenue, or reduces costs in alignment with the strategy of the<br />
organization&#8217;. That&#8217;s pith because it not only identifies revenue or cost as<br />
the driver, but alignment with business strategy. For Chris, the place to look<br />
for business value is in the outputs of the system. It is the outputs that you<br />
can measure for business value. So once we identify an output, we &#8216;pop the<br />
stack&#8217; to find its business value.</p>
<p><b>Whither Use Cases?</b></p>
<p>Of late I have been wondering about the correspondence between examples and<br />
use cases and questioning whether as we emphasize modelling from examples that<br />
use cases did not have it right all along. So it is interesting in Liz&#8217;s<br />
article to pick up on the same question from Eric Evans, and respond that<br />
&#8220;You can&#8217;t ask a business person for a use case unless they&#8217;re already<br />
technical enough to know what a use case is. But you can ask them for an<br />
example&#8221;. That implies that they are two different approaches to the same<br />
goal, but the user is placed in the driving seat with examples. It&#8217;s a good<br />
explanation of the difference.</p>
<p><b>Intersection with DDD</b></p>
<p>Interestingly enough at Domain Driven Design Exchange, Gojko Adzic presented<br />
on the intersection of BDD and DDD and feature injection was at the heart of<br />
how he saw the two corresponding. You can see Gojko&#8217;s presentation <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/design-architecture/ddd-tdd-bdd">here</a>.<br />
Gojko&#8217;s main assertion, as I understand it, is that having used <a href="http://domaindrivendesign.org/node/104">Distillation</a> (figuring<br />
out what is <a href="http://domaindrivendesign.org/node/99">Core Domain</a> where you<br />
expend modelling effort, as opposed a Supporting Domain, where you don&#8217;t) to<br />
decide what to build we hold <a href="http://www.acceptancetesting.info/key-ideas/specification-workshop/">Specification<br />
Workshop</a> to drive out the scope using Feature Injection. We then model<br />
using to the scenarios outlined for the stories to create a <a href="http://domaindrivendesign.org/node/132">Ubiquitous Language</a>. At<br />
the same time Eric Evans spoke about his perspective on Agile and DDD, looking<br />
at DDD&#8217;s need to produce a Ubiquitous Language and asking if that was in<br />
conflict with Agile preference for &#8220;Last Responsible Moment&#8221; over<br />
BDUF. Again the solution space seemed to me to focus on modelling from<br />
examples, with enough modelling up front, followed by further modelling as the<br />
model is stressed. You can see Eric&#8217;s talk <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/design-architecture/folding-together-ddd-agile">here</a>,<br />
which includes a prototypical discussion of his Whirlpool approach.</p>
<p><b>Is there too much focus on the UI here though?</b></p>
<p>One of my concerns about the process as written is some of the focus on UI.<br />
I understand the principle that the user consumes through the UI and it is<br />
therefore the only valid test of the system, but this overlooks the extent to<br />
which the UI is in flux during the early part of development. Indeed the<br />
approach identifies that we need to release early to get feedback on the UI and<br />
revise. Those revisions cause issues for tests that are focused on the UI,<br />
because as the UI changes, the tests break. Rick Mugridge in <i>Fit for<br />
Developing Software</i> is to test the business rules, not the workflow.
 </p>
<p>Now I don&#8217;t want folks to get the wrong impression here. We product a Balsamiq mockup of our user interface as part of the discussion on any story, often as part of our describe step, and we iterate over it. So I am certainly not saying that the UI is not vital to successful delivery to the customer or to understanding what is to be delivered. However I am more cautious around automate testing that focuses on the UI as the driver for development. I would rather drive from the rules than a UI focused test. We still have story tests to help &#8216;build the right thing&#8217;, in Fitnesse (replace with Cucumber, Fit, Slim, Specflow, StoryTeller etc) but they are<a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/Layer%20Test.html"> subcutaneous tests</a>. Much of our UI testing is via Exploratory Testing, and automated UI suites check only stable areas and act as smoke tests for regression issues.</p>
<p><b>Summary</b></p>
<p>All in all, very interesting stuff, that I will be looking into more as I try to refine my BDD practice</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>An interesting question that sometimes emerges for teams using XP practices is whether Testers (should you be lucky enough to have them) are Customers or Developers. There is a slight catch in the question itself. Customer and Developer are roles, not jobs, or people. A person can adopt either role. However a person should not adopt both roles at the same time. That said there is a clear distinction between the activities performed by the two roles which might best be defined as Customer determines &#8216;what&#8217; and Developer determines &#8216;how&#8217;.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/customer.html">In XP Customers</a> define the requirements (in the form of user stories and supporting detail), prioritize stories, and participate in functional testing. <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/functionaltests.html">The Customer defines scenarios</a> which verify that the story is &#8216;done, done&#8217;. In contrast Developers <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/iterationplanning.html">provide estimates</a> and <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/map/development.html">build the solution</a> that passes the <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/functionaltests.html">acceptance tests</a>. Crossing the streams &#8211; Customers indicating how they want something built or Developers defining what to build always ends in a loss of the insights each specialism provides and should be avoided. Trying to decide how and what at the same time also leads to poor solutions. Often as the requirement is built around a proposed, often non-optimal solution, obscuring the true need. Other times we try to automate existing process based of manual or legacy practices over defining what the need is. Try to seperate defining what from how.</p>
<p>With this understanding testers naturally fit within the Customer role &#8211; because they work on defining tests for what the system does and have responsibility for confirming them. This means that for testers, understanding the domain of the system-under-test becomes a key responsibility to help them fulfill their role.</p>
