Sorry about that. Get yourself a coffee<br />
and a comfy chair.</p>
<p>I have spoken in the past about <a href="/blogs/ian_cooper/archive/2009/03/31/seizing-the-bdd-nettle.aspx">our path</a> to Behavior-Driven Development (<a href="http://behaviour-driven.org/">BDD</a>)<br />
through <a href="http://industriallogic.com/papers/storytest.pdf">Story Test Driven Development</a> (STDD) and <a href="http://testobsessed.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/atddexample.pdf">Acceptance Test Driven Developmen</a>t (ATDD). Those<br />
of you who have been paying attention will know that we essentially started<br />
with a vanilla STDD approach to acceptance testing.</p>
<p>I wanted to talk a little bit about how we are authoring,<br />
structuring, and organizing our tests today. Over the past couple of years I<br />
have found that these are of greater concern than the technology you use. The<br />
difference in technologies is perhaps mainly significant to the extent that<br />
they help support authoring, structuring, or organization of story tests. I am<br />
partially documenting this to help others who might find insight, but also to seek<br />
feedback from others. I&#8217;m not trying to hold this up as exemplary. We certainly<br />
have our weaknesses and failures which we need to address. However, I thought<br />
some might find it useful to share my experience on this today.</p>
<p><b>From story to test</b></p>
<p>We use user stories to capture requirements. These do not<br />
have enough detail to develop and are always a place holder for further<br />
conversation prior to development.</p>
<p>Years ago, way before any testing TLAs, I delivered software<br />
for primary care to the National Health Service (NHS, the UK&#8217;s public health<br />
provider). Every year we received new requirements that we had to meet to get<br />
our software accredited as providing the functionality someone in primary care<br />
needed. We received this in two packages. One was a conventional list of<br />
requirements; the other was a test pack. The test pack had a set of scenarios,<br />
some end-to-end, some covering a specific feature that needed to pass before<br />
you could get accreditation. Early we learnt that the test pack was the best<br />
source of information on what we needed to build to be &#8216;done&#8217;. Requirements are<br />
vague and open to interpretation. Scenarios are concrete, specific, and rarely<br />
have interpretation. Ever get that moment where you built something, and then<br />
had an argument with the person who wrote the requirement because they just<br />
told you that your implementation is nothing like their requirements. Ever had<br />
them point to some sentence that you overlooked, that changes the whole<br />
perception of how you deliver the story. Scenarios avoid that problem because<br />
they call attention to the correct behavior of the software.&nbsp; </p>
<p>So the ideal is to capture the scenarios that the software<br />
should support. Those give you the conditions for accepting the story as done.<br />
Strictly acceptance tests for a user story are <i>story tests</i>.</p>
<p>Now the composition of your team will dictate to some extent<br />
who is responsible for the parts of this process. In most cases I have found it<br />
unlikely that the users of your software will be able to express the scenarios<br />
though sometimes you might get acceptance criteria from them. In our case we<br />
have domain experts who act as proxies for real customers, so we ask them to<br />
define acceptance criteria &#8211; usually just a list &#8211; of things that a successful<br />
implementation will represent. Our acceptance criteria looks a little like<br />
this:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>I<br />
     expect that the Follow Up Date entered can be prior to the date the Follow<br />
     Up Date is entered</li>
<li>I<br />
     expect that a Follow Up Date can be changed</li>
<li>I<br />
     expect that the Follow Up Date format should follow the format dd-MMM-yyyy</li>
<li>I<br />
     expect to be able to ether enter a date or select from a calendar</li>
<li>I<br />
     expect that activity history will record the previous Follow Up D</li>
</ul>
<p>In our case we then have a separate QA function, who then<br />
turn these acceptance criteria into scenarios that then need testing. We rarely<br />
find that the end user looks at the test regardless of the medium used for<br />
them. The idea that Fitnesse or Cucumber supports customer writing the tests is<br />
only really true when you understand Customer in the XP sense as a role which<br />
includes BAs, QA, etc..</p>
<p>In an ideal&nbsp;world we would get all of these scenarios<br />
before beginning development, ideally by planning. That&#8217;s certainly the model<br />
outline in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fit-Developing-Software-Framework-Integrated/dp/0321269349/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1268918033&amp;sr=8-1">FIT for Developing Software</a> (which is a great<br />
introduction to Story Test Driven Development)&nbsp; In the actual world we get<br />
some, but for others we both work from the acceptance criteria and communicate<br />
about the scenario when we begin work on the story. The key is though that you<br />
are driving with the tests either as criteria or fully-fledged scenarios. The<br />
tests tell you what to build and when you are done. </p>
<p>Jim Shore refers to this communication as <a href="http://jamesshore.com/Blog/How-I-Use-Fit.html">describe-demonstrate-develop</a>.<br />
The emphasis is on reached a shared understanding of what we should build and<br />
communicate that over using a specific tool to test with.</p>
<p>Interestingly we occasionally fall down on getting scenarios<br />
written and end up developing off the acceptance criteria. The result is all to<br />
predictable. What gets developed is not quite right, or what was quite intended<br />
and we end up with re-work. We certainly need to get better at this discipline.<br />
A root cause analysis tends to suggest that what fails for us here is the<br />
communication about what we should build. The storytest first approach is<br />
forcing the correct behavior of understanding the story before we build it.</p>
<p>Scenarios are where you begin to see the value of<br />
Given-When-Then as an organizing principle. Given I have an application in this<br />
state, when I make this change, then the new state of the application should<br />
be&#8230;</p>
<p>So for the above scenario we might write a scenario that<br />
looks something like (don&#8217;t worry if you don&#8217;t get the domain):</p>
<p><i>Given that I have an Application subjectivity against a risk</i></p>
<p><i>with a Follow Up Date of 11-MAR-09</i></p>
<p><i>When I set a Follow Up Date of 24-MAR-09</i></p>
<p><i>Then the Subjectivity Follow Up Date should be 24-MAR-09</i></p>
<p><i>and the subjectivity should have an activity history record<br />
of New Follow Up Date </i></p>
<p><i>with a Previous Follow Up Date of 11-MAR-09</i></p>
<p><b>What&#8217;s the difference between story and unit tests where I<br />
have both?</b></p>
<p>In one sense there is no difference. You have a set of<br />
acceptance criteria which you need to conform to. You have scenarios that<br />
exercise these criteria. Each scenario sets up pre-conditions, exercises the<br />
system under test (SUT) and confirms the post-conditions. Both story and unit<br />
tests can confirm this. The difference is that the story checks the whole, but<br />
I might wish to confirm a portion of the whole and that is when I need a unit<br />
test. The unit test gives me greater defect localization. When the story test<br />
fails I would hope that there would be a unit test failing somewhere that would<br />
let me identify why the story test failed. If not I would look at the<br />
interaction between the unit tested parts as being the source of the issue. So<br />
a major difference between story and unit tests is granularity.</p>
<p>There is definitely some pressure here with folks<br />
occasionally feeling that we are &#8216;testing twice&#8217; once in the acceptance test<br />
and once in the unit test. Most developers would prefer just to write the unit<br />
test and not have to implement the acceptance test. I believe that acceptance<br />
testing comes into its own for ensuring we have developed the right work and<br />
during large-scale refactoring.</p>
<p>However, I think this feeling, that the acceptance tests are<br />
not adding value, occurs most often when you slide into post-implementation<br />
Fitnesse testing because your scenarios were not ready. A lot of the value-add<br />
comes from defining and understanding the scenario up-front. Much of the value<br />
in acceptance testing comes from agreeing what &#8216;done&#8221; means. That is often<br />
less clear than people think and defining a test usually reveals a host of<br />
disagreements and tacit assumptions.&nbsp; When we find ourselves questioning<br />
the Fitnesse tests it is often a symptom that we have slipped into &#8216;test after&#8217;.<br />
Interestingly when Jim Shore posts about <a href="http://jamesshore.com/Blog/Alternatives-to-Acceptance-Testing.html">stopping acceptance testing</a>, his alternative<br />
seems to be exactly the kind of example-driven approach that we would consider<br />
storytests to produce. Overall I think the direction people are heading is the<br />
same &#8211; focus on scenarios that can be automated by developers.&nbsp; Whenever<br />
we slide on acceptance tests and drift toward starting with unit tests we often<br />
find ourselves in re-work because we end up building the wrong thing. The unit<br />
tests mean the wrong thing works, but it&#8217;s still the wrong thing. [More than<br />
that, it's just plan helpful. As I write this the acceptance tests are<br />
prompting me to make an aspect of the current story go red that I had forgotten<br />
about earlier; more proff that acceptance tests help you to navigate towards<br />
done].</p>
<p>It is hard to write unit tests as part of the definition of<br />
the story. You don&#8217;t necessarily know how you will build the story at planning<br />
or definition. The classes that implement the functionality probably don&#8217;t<br />
exist, and you cannot exercise them from a test fixture at that point. Tools<br />
like Cucumber and Fitnesse de-couple authoring a test from implementing the<br />
test fixture for that test. This enables you to author the scenario in your<br />
test automation tool, before you begin implementing the fixture that exercises<br />
the SUT. This is the key to enabling a test-first approach where you need to<br />
communicate the scenario for confirmation prior to commencing work, such as<br />
planning. Tools like <a href="http://fitnesse.org/">Fitnesse<br />
</a>or <a href="http://cukes.info/">Cucumber</a><br />
is to provide an easy mechanism to communicate your scenarios.&nbsp; We find<br />
that Fitnesse allows customer and developer to communicate about the scenario<br />
before implementation. You can also see the results of executing it. </p>
<p>Because the conversation is more important than the tool, a<br />
tool like Fitnesse or Cucumber may not be appropriate to for the acceptance<br />
test. The most likely case is that you do not have any business rules to put<br />
under test. Don&#8217;t feel constrained to use a particular tool. The most important<br />
thing is to define the acceptance test and then decide what tool is appopriate<br />
to automate the test. We even have some cases where the value of automation is<br />
too low. Where we are configuring the system for example, it may be easier to<br />
test the rules that work with the configured system than test the act of<br />
configuring the system itself.</p>
<p>One interesting aspect not really considered here though is<br />
that the coverage provided by the more granular unit tests is still something<br />
of a &#8216;blind spot&#8217;. I&#8217;m still not sure how to resolve that, or if the customer<br />
is genuinely concerned at that level anyway. <a href="http://gojko.net/2010/03/01/are-tools-necessary-for-acceptance-testing-or-are-they-just-evil/#more-1633">But acceptance testing is as much about communicating what<br />
is acceptance intent as &#8216;testing&#8217;</a>. Hence we separate test and<br />
fixture.</p>
<p>In addition another difference for us is that our acceptance<br />
tests may be an be end-to-end tests of the system. There is a trade off here.<br />
Our acceptance tests need to run within a sufficiently short time window that<br />
developers will exercise them. End-to-end tests often end up expensive in time<br />
to run, so folks stop running our tests. So we sometimes mock &#8216;expensive&#8217;<br />
calls. Using an IoC container can help here, and we have some common code that<br />
allows us to choose which services to mock out when setting up a new acceptance<br />
test fixture. End-to-end tests also create a web of dependencies that may fail<br />
for setup reasons. That can become painful in configuration heavy systems. At<br />
the same time if the tests cannot simply set up and tear down, that may itself<br />
be a smell that you need more effort spent on automatic build and deployment of<br />
the system.&nbsp; Going end-to-end here does gives us confidence that the<br />
system works when the parts are hooked together. While we started with a lot of<br />
end-to-end tests we seem to moving away from them toward more tests with<br />
&#8216;expensive&#8217; collaborators mocked out. One trick here may be to seperate between<br />
those acceptance tests that exercise&nbsp; business rules, which may make<br />
heavier use of mocks for components that do not influence the test and a few<br />
tracer bullet tests that ensure the whole is working together.</p>
<p><b>Testing business rules not workflow</b></p>
<p>One piece of advice from Rick Mugridge in <i>Fit for<br />
Developing Software</i> is to test the business rules, not the workflow. Early<br />
on we made a lot of mistakes with this. We tended to have verbose column<br />
fixtures setting every single property on each of the entities involved in the<br />
test. Part of the driving force for us on this road was that our system is<br />
configuration heavy. So to use the system you need to set up products, set up user-defined<br />
fields, set-up rules etc. This gives the system significant flexibility but<br />
creates an overhead to working with it. Thatoverhead meant that when we<br />
authored many early tests we&nbsp; needed to set up a lot of configuration<br />
data. This was too much work to write every time, and we quickly appreciated<br />
that we needed a better strategy. </p>
<p>Our first approaches to this problem involved shared set up<br />
for our fixtures. However, given sufficient properties to set this resolution<br />
is still very fragile. Worse as refactoring tools do not refactor into the text<br />
based fixture they have a tendency to break every time you refactor. Tests<br />
should enable refactoring not become an obstacle to them. Any time the team<br />
stops refactoring because of the rigidity to the tests, you have a quick way to<br />
end any team&#8217;s love affair with storytest approaches.</p>
<p>So we needed a better way to factor out all of that setup<br />
code. Our next approach was to provide tooling to allow the system to be setup<br />
into a known state. Essentially we wrote support for exporting setup from a<br />
system as XML and for importing it. This could then be used as part of the<br />
setup of a scenario to put the system into a known state. This also had<br />
benefits for deployment as it let us automate configuration of environments and<br />
import/export records between systems. So, as is often the case, making it<br />
simpler to test also gave us architectural improvements.</p>
<p>However, our biggest win probably came from using test data<br />
builders to configure the system.</p>
<p><b>Omitting all that setup code</b></p>
<p>Some time ago I wrote about how we <a href="/blogs/ian_cooper/archive/2008/10/17/testdatabuilders.aspx">switched from using Object Mother to Test Data Builder</a>.<br />
That gave us enormous benefits within the domain model, because it made it easy<br />
to do state based testing. It is also very expressive, because I can <a href="/blogs/gregyoung/archive/2008/04/22/dddd-8-fluent-builders-and-tests.aspx">highlight the variables that impact that test</a>.<br />
This makes the test much easier to read. You can think of this as using a stub<br />
for those values you do not need to control and overriding those that you do<br />
need to control for the test. So if we want to set up a new entity we might<br />
have some code like the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
submission = new SubmissionBuilder()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
.WithBrokerReference(new BrokerReference {BrokerName = &#8220;Flintstones&#8221;,<br />
BranchName = &#8220;Flintstones &#8211; WA&#8221;})<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
.WithMarket(new Market(&#8220;Small Business&#8221;))<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
.Build();</p>
<p>Many acceptance tests can be handled in a similar fashion -<br />
use defaults for anything in the setup of the fixture that does not have an<br />
impact on what is under test. Essentially we choose to treat the Given<br />
statements in the same way we handle our test data builders. The given<br />
statements call out specific variables that effect the test, but otherwise rely<br />
on default &#8216;stub&#8217; values produced by an underlying builder. So the equivalent<br />
of the above code on an acceptance test would be something like</p>
<p><i>Given a submission</i></p>
<p><i>With a broker named Flintstones and a branch named<br />
Flintstones &#8211; WA</i></p>
<p><i>With a market of Small Business</i></p>
<p><i>When&#8230;</i></p>
<p><i>Then&#8230;</i></p>
<p>The advantage here is that we get a good signal to noise<br />
ration when setting up the fixture to use with our test. We don&#8217;t just stub out<br />
values that the test does not depend on, we highlight those that it does depend<br />
on. In the fixture implementation we use the builder pattern to implement the<br />
Given statements for the fixture. We tend to be able to re-use these builders<br />
across a number of tests. Our fixture implementation for Fitnesse looks<br />
something like:</p>
<p>public void GivenASubmission()<br />
{<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; submissionBuilder = new SubmissionPersistentBuilder(ioc);<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (lastCreatedAccount != null)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
submissionBuilder.WithAccount(lastCreatedAccount);<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br />
}</p>
<p>public void WhenTheBrokerNameIs(string brokerName)<br />
{<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; submissionBuilder.WithBrokerName(brokerName);<br />
}</p>
<p>public void WhenTheBrokerBranchNameIs(string branchName)<br />
{<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; submissionBuilder.WithBrokerBranchName(branchName);<br />
}</p>
<p>public void ThenASubmissionIsCreated()<br />
{<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bool result;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lastCreatedSubmission = submissionBuilder.Build();<br />
}</p>
<p>Note that we tend to have an extra Then step to build all<br />
the Given and With statements, before we exercise the SUT. The issue here is<br />
that we wanted to have a statement that says, build the above, so that we could<br />
create a base flow fixture that would allow re-use in derived fixtures of much<br />
of the setup code. </p>
<p><i>Given a submission</i></p>
<p><i>With a broker named Flintstones and a branch named<br />
Flintstones &#8211; WA</i></p>
<p><i>With a market of Small Business</i></p>
<p><i>Then a submission is created</i></p>
<p><i>When&#8230;</i></p>
<p><i>Then&#8230;</i></p>
<p>This is also the reason for often checking for Last Built<br />
Foo &#8211; to see if a prior build step in the test constructed the object. If you<br />
were only looking to re-use at the builder and not the fixture level, then this<br />
would not be an issue to you. We could probably clean this syntax up and I<br />
guess that is on the to do list. The advantage of some re-use here is the speed<br />
boost it gives you getting the Given portion of your fixture working, letting<br />
you get to the red part of red-green-refactor all the sooner. That means you<br />
can get past the grunt work and into the interesting part &#8211; implementing the<br />
desired functionality.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that sometimes you get a parameterized<br />
test, in that you want to test the same scenario repeatedly, but for a range of<br />
values. A column based test-fixture can work really well here &#8211; columns either<br />
represent the variable inputs or the outputs. Just because we tend to use the<br />
Given-When-Then style does not mean we should not use opportunity to keep the<br />
intent (<a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/Four%20Phase%20Test.html">Setup, Exercise, Verify, Teardown</a>) without<br />
becoming overly verbose.</p>
<p><b>How do I find my acceptance criteria in future?</b></p>
<p>One problem with acceptance tests is how to organize them.<br />
When we started we organized them by story. Find the story, find its acceptance<br />
tests. The stories were organized by iteration. Twenty-seven sprints in that<br />
early plan looks naive. We have too many stories and sprints to find our<br />
acceptance tests by that organizing principle. </p>
<p>The first problem is that I often want to add to an existing<br />
scenario for new functional requirements instead of always creating a new one.<br />
This becomes hard if you couple story and acceptance tests, because you either<br />
need to duplicate or add new acceptance criteria to the old story. </p>
<p>The second problem is that as an executable specification of<br />
the code our tests have a lot of value, but not much if we cannot find it. We<br />
should be able to find from our tests what the behavior of the system is.</p>
<p>Our current solution is to organize the acceptance tests<br />
along the same lines as the site. For a given webpage on the site, we have a<br />
given page in our Fitnesse wiki that tells you what the scenarios supported by<br />
that page are. The mapping cannot be entirely one-to-one in that sometimes we<br />
pop up a dialog, or perform some other workflow that we are not interested in<br />
simulating in business rule focused tests. But it is close enough to make finding<br />
the definition of the behavior easy.</p>
<p>The conceit here is that you could have the site open on one<br />
screen and the acceptance tests open in another and have effective and<br />
executable documentation for the behavior of that page. It is a little bit<br />
conceited, but it works well enough to be a useful organizing principle.</p>
<p><b>Old tests, cleaning up, and throwing out</b></p>
<p>Some of our acceptance tests get bent out-of-shape by<br />
incremental change to the system. The best answer is often to throw them away<br />
and start again. One advantage of the &#8216;reflect the site&#8217; approach above is that<br />
it gets easier to see when to re-write. With acceptance tests even more than<br />
unit tests it often seems to be better, to understand intent and re-write to reflect<br />
the new state of the site than try to fix up old tests.</p>
<p><b>But what about the User Interface!</b></p>
<p>One obvious point here is that no user interface has been<br />
defined as yet. One obvious problem is that testing through the UI depends on<br />
the UI being completed to define tests. However, it can be worth thinking about<br />
mocking up the UI at the same time as you write the scenarios using a tool like<br />
<a href="http://www.balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a>.
</p>
<p>We had a struggle at the beginning of the project over responsibility for defining<br />
how this should look before realizing that it needed to be co-operative. In the<br />
end it all comes back to the Agile emphasis on communication. The Customer asks<br />
for features, but the Developers need to negotiate how the features will be<br />
implemented inputting their understanding of how hard or easy something is, or<br />
what opportunities or approaches present themselves. </p>
<p>The difficulty with many<br />
traditional requirements documents is that they focus on the UI as a mechanism<br />
for defining the requirements. In essence the UI and its behavior becomes the<br />
requirement. By separating out acceptance testing we begin the journey of separating<br />
what we want from how it will be implemented. That gives us more chance to<br />
isolate the business rules. Once we understand what the user is trying to<br />
achieve it is easier to discuss how we will achieve it. That tends to lead us<br />
away with simply providing an electronic version of paper or legacy system<br />
process they may use today, toward process they can use tomorrow.</p>
<p>Some folks still like to work from the UI down, whereas I want them to work from the acceptance tests on down, then hook up to the UI. It&#8217;s probably all tilting at windmills at some point, but for me whilst both are essential to getting it right, I see more cost in the majority of cases to the rework for not getting the business rule right than to changing the UI.</p>

If you can prove at a moment&#8217;s notice that the system does what they asked for, and the traceabilty from those proofs to the original specification is trivial (ie. an identity mapping) then you&#8217;ve gone a long way towards getting a recalcitrant customer to sign off on the delivery.</p>
<p>Of course, having a recalcitrant customer in the first place is indicative of bigger problems, but still, I&#8217;d rather have the acceptance tests in this scenario than not have them.</p>

						<div id="dsq-comment-message-810" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>@Paul I agree that using acceptance tests to describe UI interaction can be an anti-pattern for text based fixture tools like Fitnesse. The value of those tools is in testing the business rules not the UI workflow. That said it is possible to create &#8216;acceptance tests&#8217; for UI even if they are exercised with a different tool like Selenium or a manual test script. The advantage of thinking about a test script is that it can be written before the UI is finalized and forms a definition of expected behavior even if later automated. The issue with UI automation tools is that they are always test-after and may just bake in automation of the wrong functionality.</p>

<p>For me Acceptance Tests are about making sure you &#8216;build the right thing&#8217; over &#8216;built it right&#8217; so you may not always be end-to-end. There is a need to demonstrate the whole thing hooks together, via exploratory testing or the like, but its not really the sweet sport for acceptance testing. The issue is the cost of full automated end-to-end tests.</p>

<p>Agreed.  GWT is mainly useful to me as insight on how to capture a scenario using a template that drives certain behaviour through its language. But when actually implementing the test you need to watch for parameterization etc.</p>
